Justice Abdul Kafarati of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday struck out the application by the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, seeking nullification of his ongoing trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT. Saraki had in his application before the Justice Kafarati-led court requested that his ongoing trial at the Tribunal be stopped, claiming it’s an infringement on his fundamental human rights as enshrined in Section Four of the 1999 constitution and an obstruction to his duties at the National Assembly. Justice Kafarati in his ruling, however, held that the court of law cannot interfere with the legal obligations of the CCT as it is a constitutional body. “I find that none of the claims fall within chapter four of the constitution” “This court cannot interfere with the proceedings before the tribunal; it cannot also interfere with the duties of the respondents which have been imposed on them by law,”Kafarati said. Noting that the trial at the tribunal cannot be regarded as an infringement on the Senate Presidents right, the judge said, “There are Criminal procedure laws that put in place the method of protecting the accused.” Justice Kafarati, while dismissing that claim that the trial at the tribunal falls short of the constitutional requirements, said such insinuation was “a sentimental claim that has no basis in law.” Saraki is currently standing trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal for alleged false declaration of assets and fraud while he was still the governor of Kwara State.
