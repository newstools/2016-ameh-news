Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has sworn in a judicial commission of inquiry into the violence/ killings that negatively affected the March 19 legislative re-run election, with a charge to the commission to get to the root of the matter.  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC ) had suspended elections in eight local government areas of the state because of violence and killings. A serving member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Samuel Okonta, was also killed while working as an ad hoc staff member of INEC in the elections. Swearing in the members of the commission under the chairmanship of Justice Monima Wenike Danagogo on Wednesday, Wike decried the violence witnessed during the re-run elections, saying that it was necessary to ascertain the root causes with a view to checking a recurrence in the future. He charged the commission to identify those involved in the killings, those killed and the scope of violence during the elections. The governor also charged the commission to identify property damaged in the course of the violence and the owners of such property.
