Following the reaffirmation on Wednesday by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, that the scarcity of petrol in Nigeria will cease by next month, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) have said that they will embark on comprehensive monitoring of the distribution and sale of petrol at service stations across the country. Both DPR and IPMAN said in separate statements that they sent to THISDAY Thursday in Abuja that they will intensity their monitoring to curtail instances of product hoarding and sales racketeering amongst marketers. The DPR statement was signed by its Director, Mr. Mordecai Ladan while that of IPMAN was signed by its interim management Secretary, Lawson Ngoa. Every effort is being made to ensure that petroleum products supply and distribution situation in the country is normalised.
“Marketers must ensure that petroleum products get across to Nigerians timely and at the regulated prices,” said Ladan. He further stated: “Government is making petroleum products sufficiently available, therefore, DPR urges all operators of petroleum product depots, filling stations as well as tanker drivers and other stakeholders to desist from unwholesome activities of hoarding, diversion, adulteration and pump manipulation in order to avoid untoward hardship to motorists and the general public.”
