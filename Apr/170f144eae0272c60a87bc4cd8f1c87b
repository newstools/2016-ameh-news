Sequel to revelations made by the embattled Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Tope Aluko that the 2014 governorship poll in Ekiti State was rigged, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress , Mr Olusegun Osinkolu , has vowed that the party would resist attempt to subvert the will of the voters in the next elections. He said the whole world was already aware of how PDP deployed military personnel and other security agencies to rig ex-Governor Kayode Fayemi out of office, insisting that every machinery of government will be positioned to ensure free and fair poll in 2018. The APC senatorial aspirant also warned those resisting the conduct of primaries for the selection of governorship candidate in APC to bury the thought, saying the party members would frustrate efforts by a clique to impose its own preferred candidate , rather than what Ekiti wants. Osinkolu made the statements in Ayede Ekiti on Friday while meeting with its coordinators in the five local governments that constitutes Ekiti North senatorial district to reignite its senatorial aspiration for 2019.
