Former Senate President, David Mark has explained why the Peoples Democratic Party was defeated in the 2015 general elections. He attributed the reason for the defeat to imposition of candidates. According to his spokesperson, Paul Mumeh, he spoke on Monday in Otukpo, his Benue State country home, where he held a meeting with PDP faithful. Speaking ahead of the party’s congresses and convention, Mark “canvassed strongly for the repositioning of the Party (PDP) if it must return to power in the next general election.” “We must come to terms with reality that PDP lost the last general election because of over bearing tendencies of some leaders who imposed candidates on the people. “It is inevitable that we must change from the old ways and allow the will of the people prevail. Unfolding events clearly show that the PDP is the party for the people. But we must not take them for granted by forcing unpopular candidates on the people. “The coast is clear that the PDP has the road map for peace, unity and development of Nigeria. Nigerians now know the difference,” he said. Mark, therefore, counselled that popular candidates be put forward to “drive the ship of the party ahead of the next general elections.” He stressed that the PDP had bright chances of returning to power if all party faithful agreed to work together in one accord. To achieve such, he stated that people must learn to sacrifice their individual or personal interest for the larger interests.
