The Nigeria Prisons Service, NPS, has said investigation has commenced into the alleged beating of a female Lawmaker by the aides of Controller General of Nigeria Prisons, Dr. Peter Ekpendu, at the National Assembly complex on Wednesday. Some personnel of the prisons CG were said to have assaulted and harassed Rep Mrakpor Onyeamaechi Jona (PDP, Delta) on Wednesday. The lawmaker was said to have been leaving for a service while the convoy of the CG Prisons was passing. She was blocked and an aide to the CG battered her car. One of the security officers slapped her on the face, while the CG was watching. Speaking on the incident, the NPS’s spokesperson, Mr. Francis Enobore, said the CG only heard of the alleged assault on Thursday afternoon and he has immediately constituted a panel of inquiry into the matter. Although Enobore could not fathom how any of the operatives would have jumped down from the CG’s convoy to assault anybody not to talk of a serving lawmaker right in the National Assembly complex, he promised that the Service would leave no stone unturned until the truth of the matter is revealed. He said: “We were all present at the National Assembly on Wednesday with the CG. He had a long convoy, but we all left the place together at the same time and while we were at the place, there was no fight or quarrel between any of our personnel and anyone around. As we all left together with the CG, it is not possible for anyone of us to have jumped down from the convoy and went back to the complex to fight anybody.”
