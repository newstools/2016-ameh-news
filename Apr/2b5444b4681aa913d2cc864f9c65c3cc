President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated his administration’s   commitment to the exploration of the country’s vast potentials in the agricultural sector to strengthen the nation’s economy.
The president who was represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh,  yesterday at the opening ceremony of the 9th National Agricultural Show in Tudun Wada, along the Abuja-Keffi Express Way, said his administration’s roadmap in agriculture from  2016 to 2020 was to produce food not only for Nigeria, but for the whole of humanity.  “Our objective is  to build an agribusiness economy capable of meeting our domestic food security requirements, generating export to strengthen our current revenue base and supporting sustainable income and job growth potentials through wealth creation, promotion of entrepreneurial activities, youth employment and enhancing national productivity,” the president said.
He added that the agricultural show was in line with the determination of his administration to restore agriculture and agro enterprises to their respective domain of pride and importance as the key drivers of inclusive growth, sheer prosperity and sustainable development in Nigeria.
Buhari noted that the nation could no longer afford to neglect this strategic area of national enterprise as was done over the years, adding, “The present hardship we are encountering is as a result of over-reliance on oil and gas,” he said.
Earlier, the chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Senator Abdullahi  Adamu, said the 2016 show focuses on encouraging  youths in agriculture as they undermine the sector.
“It is important for us to get our youths back to the land. If our youths are the leaders of tomorrow, they must also appreciate the place of agriculture in our national development. Our ageing peasant farmers cannot adapt to modern agricultural methods any more, we expect our youths to take over for their own sake and the sake of our country,” he said.
