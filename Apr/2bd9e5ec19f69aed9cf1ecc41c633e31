Amid the fuel scarcity and economic crisis, President Muhammadu Buhari will start a state visit to China from April 11 till 15. A major highlight of the visit will likely be signing a $2billion loan deal with China that will finance Nigeria’s badly-needed infrastructure projects. “I can’t tell you how much until the day the loan will be signed,” his spokesman, Femi Adesina said in an interview with Reuters. “Both countries will also be signing some bilateral agreements to strengthen their relationship, that is all I can say now”, he added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang had earlier said in Beijing that Buhari would visit China to sign “cooperation agreements” and attend a business forum. He gave no details.
