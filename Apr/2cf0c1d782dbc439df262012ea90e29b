The Katsina State Judicial Commission of Inquiry to investigate alleged N70.3 billion missing during immediate past administration, held its inaugural sitting in Katsina on Tuesday. The Chairman of the commission, Justice Muhammad Surajo, restated that it was mandated to investigate and determine the extent of funds lost and lapses that paved way for the loss. Surajo said: “We urge members of the public to submit their memoranda within two weeks as the commission is given three months to submit its recommendation to government. We were sworn in to be just and fair to all. Opportunity will be given to everybody to present facts and evidences during our sitting. “I assure the people of Katsina that the commission will discharge its duties with fairness, justice and without fear or favour.” Surajo called on lawyers to cooperate with the commission to enable it succeed. Counsel to the Peoples Democratic Party, Aliyu Ahmed, said the commission had passed judgment on the investigation, as it placed an advertisement where it said that funds were missing during the PDP administration. Ahmed said: “They did not say that it was an allegation against the past PDP administration. So I am standing for guilty people.” He urged the commission to serve them with copies of the memorandum submitted before the commission. The counsel to the commission, Hassan Liman, assured that they would do everything possible to assist the commission to succeed. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that some youths staged a protest against the commencement of the sitting of the commission. The youths carried placards with inscriptions alleging witch hunting of officials of the former government. The funds allegedly got missing during the tenure of former Governor Ibrahim Shema between 2011 and 2015.
