Nigeria’s initial oil export plan for June showed crude loadings poised to fall to the lowest level so far this year, according to a compilation of loading programmes on Monday, Reuters reports. The exports, on 52 cargoes, totalled 1.57 million barrels per day (bpd), compared with a revised May programme of 1.6 million bpd aboard 55 cargoes. The export plans did not include Erha, which is the subject of a disagreement between ExxonMobil and Nigeria’s NNPC. There has still been no May loading programme issued for for the grade. If Erha export cargoes are issued, it would likely push the June exports above April, the previous 2016 low, when just under 1.60 million bpd were scheduled for export. Nigeria’s oil production has been hampered by a force majeure on the Forcados pipeline stream that has been in place since February and on which repairs will take until June to be completed.
