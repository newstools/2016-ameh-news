Apart from the recent arrest of Khalid al-Barnawi, the leader of Ansaru terrorist group in Lokoja, Kogi State, the Nigerian military has confirmed that more terrorists have been arrested, while other Boko Haram members have also surrendered to the security agencies. The Director Defence information, Brigadier Rabe Abubakar, who confirmed this development to PRNigeria yesterday disclosed that: “With ongoing aggressive military operations in the North-East, some Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered to the Nigerian troops just as some top commanders were arrested while fleeing from the theater of war. The improved synergy and inter-agency collaborations have enhanced the various operations towards the massive arrest of members of the terrorists’ groups. “We are conducting series of investigation including background checks on some of those arrested and those that surrendered to the security agencies for proper identification. So far most of the operations are going on smoothly. “Our concern is for Nigerians to support the military and other security agencies with useful information especially now that most of the Boko Haram camps have been destroyed; while the stubborn members may be fleeing to new locations. “We urge Nigerians to report any strange movement and people, including suspicious objects in their localities to ensure that suspects do not have new haven to hide where they may later disrupt such communities.”
