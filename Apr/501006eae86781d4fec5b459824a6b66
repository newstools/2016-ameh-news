The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Friday said that the commission was ready to conduct free and credible election in Abuja today.  The Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu gave the assurance when he visited some of the INEC Super Registration Areas Centres (RACs) to monitor the distribution of election materials. Super RACs are places where elections materials and ad-hoc staff are being disributed to wards and polling units. Yakubu said that from all indications and giving the level of preparation, the election would commence as scheduled Saturday morning. “So far so good, the situation is encouraging. At Bwari RACs the deployment of elections materials and ad-hoc staff has commenced. “Also in Gwarinpa almost all the vehicles have left execpt for few which are leaving now, ” Yakubu said. He said that the essence of the visit was to ensure that the election materials and ad-hoc staff were moved closer to thier various wards and polling units on Friday for early commencement of polls on Saturday. “Remember that some Nigerians are complaining that INEC will say that polls will open by 8:00 a.m., while materials and ad-hoc staff are yet to be at some centres. “That is why we are moving round to ensure that materials and staff are very close to the polling units on Friday, so that on Saturday ad-hoc staff can move into the polling units and set up before 8 a.m when the election will commence.” Asked if the current fuel scarcity would affect the conduct of the election, Yakubu said that the commission had put in measures to address the situation. “Fuel scarcity is really a big issue. As at the time we started preparation there was no fuel scarcity which is now affecting all and sundry, not only INEC. “Certainly it is a draw back but we have put in our best to address the situation. We are working to have a successful election by God’s grace.”
