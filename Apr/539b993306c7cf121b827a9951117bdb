The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday secured the conviction of a former member of the Kogi State House of Assembly and former Caretaker Chairman, Ogori/Magongo Local Government Area of the state, Gabriel Daudu, for a N1.4 billion fraud. Mr. Daudu, who was first arraigned in April 2010, was prosecuted by the EFCC on a 208-count charge bordering on money laundering and misappropriation of public funds. Justice Inyang Ekwo, who tried the case at the Federal High Court in Lokoja, Kogi State, found him guilty of 77 counts and sentenced him to 154-year imprisonment. In his ruling, the trial judge held that the prosecution proved its case beyond every reasonable doubt, and therefore sentenced Mr. Daudu to two years on each of the 77 counts to run concurrently. Before the conviction of the politician, prosecuting counsel, Wahab Shittu, tendered various exhibits before the court and fielded 13 witnesses to prove the case against him. In the course of the trial, Justice Ekwo indicated that the trial might have to start afresh as the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Ibrahim Auta, asked Justice P.M. Ayuba of the Lokoja Division of the court to take over the case. However, Mr. Shittu pleaded with Justice Auta to review the decision. The Chief Judge, thereafter, returned the case file to Justice Ekwo, who, Monday, found Mr. Daudu guilty of the 77 counts. Since the sentences are running concurrently, Mr. Daudu will spend only two years in jail.
