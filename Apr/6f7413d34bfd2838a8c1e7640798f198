The Zone C chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, on Sunday expressed shock over the ​abduction of a Channels Television correspondent in Owerri, Imo State, Top​​e Kuteye.
The reporter, according to reports, was abducted on Sunday from his residence in Owerri around 3am. A statement by the union’s vice president and secretary in charge of the zone, Christopher Isiguzo and Kenneth Ofoma respectively, condemned the act and urged the kidnappers to release the reporter immediately. “We condemn the kidnap of this innocent citizen and journalist,” the statement said. “Kuteye is neither a politician nor a money-bag business man. It therefore baffles the union as to why he should be the target of this dastardly act. “We therefore appeal to the abductors of Mr. Kuteye to release him unconditionally without delay. “We equally call on law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned to secure the release of Kuteye soonest should his abductors hedge. “We regret that journalists, who are always at the forefront in the battle for social change, accountability, transparency in governance and social justice should be made the victim of the vices they stood against,” the union said.
