Ayalogu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja that the company, which is also engaged in coal mining, had concluded arrangements to start constructing the power plant before the end of 2016. He said the company got a licence to provide 1,200 mega watts but it would start with 300 mega watts due to the huge capital required for the project.
