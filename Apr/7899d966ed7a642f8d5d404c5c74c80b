The embattled spokesman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Olisa Metuh, on Monday urged the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to allow his counsel more time to prepare to defend his company, Destra Investment Limited. Counsel to Metuh’s company, who is standing trial alongside the former as the second defendant in the ongoing prosecution, Toochukwu Onwuibufo made an oral application, seeking for more time and facilities to enable him prepare for defence. Onwuibufo sought for time and documents of court proceedings to enable him prepare, adding that he was only brought into the matter last week. Metuh, alongside his company, Destra Investment Limited are standing trial on a 7 count charge bordering on money laundering to the tune of N400m, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, alleged he collected from the former National Security Adviser, NSA, Col. Dasuki Sambo. Quoting section 36(6) of the constitution, Onwuibufo said, “My lord, we are incapacitated to continue with this trial unless we are given facilities and time to prepare for trial.” The prosecution led by Sylvanus Tahir in his argument said that the court should dismiss the application. Counsel to Metuh, Emeka Etiaba, however, urged the court to grant the appeal of the counsel to the second defendant, adding that the embattled PDP spokesman is prepared “with his witnesses standing outside the court to open his defence but that doesn’t mean the second defendant is not entitled to fair hearing.”
