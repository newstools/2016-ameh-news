National Chairman of the All PProgressive Congress, APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun says the party is “also planning” to checkmate plans by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to take over the Senate Presidency should Bukola Saraki be removed from the position in view of his current trial at the Code of
Conduct Tribunal, CCT.  He, however, pointed out that in an event his party forfeits the exalted position to the PDP, that may be the sacrifice it would have to pay for Change. Speaking in an interview with Premium Times, Oyegun said: “We don’t take anything for granted. As they (PDP) are planning, we are also planning. The situation is under control. The whole situation is unfortunate but it is real.” “Well, I don’t think we will loPremium position. But sometimes, for change to take place, there is price you have to pay. So losing the position may be sacrifice for change.” While ruling out the use of loPremium solution to address Saraki’s prosecution over false assets declaration charges, he asked, “What political situation in a legal matter? Are the judges politicians?” adding that “The President is certainly not the type who will interfere in a judicial matter. I think we know him well. Everybody must know him. Things must be done normally. And that is part of the change mantra that we must play by the rule so that we don’t truncate processes.”The APC boss continued: “People don’t seem to internalize what change is. If the President says “court, free that man”, the same president can say ‘court, imprison that man.’
Is that the Nigeria you want? No! Change means allowing the law to take the proper course. I can tell you the President won’t interfere. The President is straight definite, straight and firm in
all facets.”
