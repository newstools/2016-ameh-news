Tech company, Hewltt Packard (HP) has unveiled a 10.4 mm, device, the new HP Spectre, the world’s thinnest laptop. The design was inspired by women’s jewelry and ut boasts full-powered Intel processing and 9.5 hours of battery life. The new Spectre has upstaged the dominance of Apple’s Macbook Air (and more recently, Apple’s 12″ MacBook) in slim computers. At just 10.4 mm, the HP Spectre is about as thick as a AAA battery. The Spectre, which was announced at a luxury conference at Versailles with a design that HP says was inspired by jewelry and women’s purses, has some selling points that include its being functional and powerful despite being the thinnest laptop in the world. It’s bigger than the new 12″ MacBook (13.3″), yet it doesn’t sacrifice processing horsepower, rather than demure to Intel’s weaker Core M processor, the Spectre gives buyers a choice of sixth generation Core i5 or i7 processors. It’s rated for 9.5 hours of battery life, though it’s doubtful that anyone will actually see that in practice. The only big drawback may be the weak speakers, which a company rep admitted can only get but so loud. Otherwise, when it goes on pre-order April 25 and hits stores May 22, the Spectre will be in a great position to sway some potential Macbook buyers: Pre-order prices start at just $1,170, and base models at Best Buy will start at $1,250. Compared to $1,299 for the smaller, weaker new MacBook, that’s a bargain, said tech Engadget.
