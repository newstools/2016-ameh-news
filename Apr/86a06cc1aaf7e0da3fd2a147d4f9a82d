The implementation of the controversial 2016 budget will begin in a “few days”, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, has said. Prof Osinbajo said this at the 12th Edition of The Platform, a public policy forum held in Abuja. “The 2016 budget will go into full operation in the next few days,” Osinbajo said. He also said he’s aware of all the ongoing concerns Nigerians raise about the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration everyday, urging the citizens to remain patient as they work to turn around the situation in the country. The 2016 budget, which was first presented on December 22, 2015, has been marred by widespread irregularities and fraud, prompting Buhari to retrieve it for a makeover in January.PT
