Ado Ekiti — The Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has written to the Chinese Government seeking the stoppage of the $2 billion loan being sought by the Federal Government to finance deficit in the 2016 appropriation bill. ‪President Buhari’s visit to China this week was to discuss the development of the country’s infrastructure, including a $2 billion loan for railway projects, but Fayose said in his letter to the Chinese President Xi Jinping that all Nigerians were totally against the loan. Fayose is presently in Guangzhou, China to attend the 119th China Import and Export Fair otherwise known as the Canton Fair. He said, “The government of China should be mindful of the fact that Nigerians, irrespective of their political and religious affiliations are totally opposed to increment of the country’s debt burden.”‬
