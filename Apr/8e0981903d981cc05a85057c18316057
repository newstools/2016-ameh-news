Kaduna state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has closed down the Government House Clinic in Kaduna and deployed its personnel to public hospitals. Similarly, drugs and equipment in the clinic have been moved to the government-owned Yusuf Dantsoho Hospital, Tudun Wada, Kaduna, while the Government House staff had been directed to henceforth use the Yusuf Dansotho Hospital for their medical needs. Spokesman of the governor, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, said in a statement on Sunday that the decision to close down the clinic was taken to boost the healthcare system in the state by moving medical personnel, drugs and equipment to public hospitals. “There are not yet enough doctors in the public health system in Kaduna state, therefore, it is not prudent to assign doctors, nurses and other medical staff to serve Government House alone. “It is clearly more beneficial to the wider society if the services of these medical personnel were made available to the public in a general hospital. In addition, it is better that everyone working in the Government House uses the same health facilities as the general public” the statement said.
