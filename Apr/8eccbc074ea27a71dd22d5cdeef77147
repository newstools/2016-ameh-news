An established and well managed solid minerals industry is a path for economic and social growth of Nigeria. The sector, has potentials of providing employments and improve national income earnings far exceeding the petroleum sector if well managed. Our reporter examines the progress, challenges and the ways forward. Solid minerals industries are supposed to provide local raw materials for other industries and bring vital infrastructure and wealth to rural areas. Before now, the earnings from solid minerals was used to develop roads, education, hospitals and in fact develop the petroleum industry.The decline of the solid minerals industry started with the discovery of oil to an extent that Nigeria became a mono product economy and vulnerable to international oil politics. The domineering role of oil did not allow past governments to attend to global challenges that evolved in the development of the solid minerals sector. The neglect of the industry led to disorder in the minefield with strong presence of illegal miners whose activities are characterized by inefficient mining, illegal trading of highly priced minerals, severe ecological degradation, spread of diseases and huge loss of revenue to the government through smuggling. An internal analysis in reaction to the global economic recession led to key policy review which was completed and endorsed at the middle of the 1990s for implementation. The policy review led to a number of important actions including the creation of the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development in 1995.
