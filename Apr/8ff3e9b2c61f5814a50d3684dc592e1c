Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, yesterday seized the beads of the Baale of Ido, Chief Tajudeen Akinola Agura, for parading himself as the Onido. This was after the Olubadan-in-Council questioned his alleged claim to be the Onido despite suspension. The Nation reports that aside the suspension, several petitions hang around Agura’s neck, particularly on alleged land grabbing and related issues. Meanwhile, the Olubadan has warned leaders of the Igbo community in Ibadan to subject themselves to the authority of the Baales in their domains. Briefing reporters after the meeting, the Asipa Balogun of Ibadan, High Chief Tajudeen Ajibola, said: “We have taken a stance on the principle of upholding Ibadan authority. “We’ve done many things today on the issue of the man parading himself as Onido who has been suspended. “The Kabiyesi was of the view that since he has been suspended, he can not go about parading himself as Onido, wearing beads. So, we have seized his beads. The second issue was the issue of Eze Ndigbo. In any community, you cannot have two monarchs. “The only Oba in Ibadan is the Olubadan. So, no other person can call himself his royal highness in Ibadan land.” Other members of the council in attendance include the Otun Olubadan, High Chief Lekan Balogun; Osi Olubadan, High Chief Rashidi Ladoja; Osi Balogun, High Chief Femi Olaifa; the Asipa Olubadan, High Chief Eddy Oyewole; the Iyalode of Ibadan, High Chief Aminat Abiodun and Chief Lateef Gbadamosi.
