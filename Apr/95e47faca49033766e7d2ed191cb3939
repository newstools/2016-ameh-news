Many flights were delayed and few others cancelled at the weekend following the inability of most airlines to receive the volume of aviation fuel, known as Jet A1, they needed for scheduled flights operations, ThisDay reports. It was gathered that due to the paucity of the product, oil marketers resorted to rationing the product to airlines, sharing the product at the ramp, from one aircraft to another. An official of one major domestic carriers said that the fuel scarcity affected all the airlinesâ€™ operations as it caused delays and flight cancellations. He said the situation was beyond the control of what airline management could do.
