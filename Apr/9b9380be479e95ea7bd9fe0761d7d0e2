The Nigerian Government is to investigate claims that Switzerland’s Ambassador to the country is living with his husband. Eric Mayoraz arrived in Nigeria last year and – according to local newspaper, the Daily Trust – did so with his husband, a Brazilian man known as Mr Carlos. Akinremi Bolaji, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday (April 7) that the department was aware of the allegation and that it would be investigated. Mr Bolaji, said: “We are aware of the development and have started an investigation. It is either they have deceived us because we would never have allowed such a person to enter the country if we were aware before now. “We have a law, which must be obeyed by all. If we find him culpable, he will be made to face the full wrath of the law.” Mr Mayoraz has refused to comment on the investigation. A spokesman for the embassy, said: “We do not provide any information about the privacy of our employees.” It is unclear whether the Ambassdor would be entitled to diplomatic immunity, if the Nigerian authorities believed the allegations to be true. The newspaper reported that rumours surfaced last year when the Swiss Embassy introduced Mr Carlos as a member of the Association of Spouses of Heads of Missions (ASOHOM). Proving controversial, the embassy eventually withdrew from the group in December. Last year, Nigeria rejected calls from US President Barack Obama to repeal the anti-gay law stating, “sodomy is against the law in Nigeria, and abhorrent to our culture.”
