Striking medical doctors in Osun State under the aegis of Association of Medical and Dental Officers, on Sunday suspended their seven months industrial action. The chairman of the association, Isiaka Adekunle, confirmed the suspension of the strike in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, on Sunday in Osogbo. He said the doctors would report for duty on Monday.. Mr. Adekunle said that though the government was yet to meet any of their demands, their decision to resume work was in response to appeals from well-meaning people of the state. He, however, said that the association would continue to dialogue with the government. Mr. Adekunle said the association took the decision to call off the strike at its Annual General Meeting held on March 30. He said: â€œthe Speaker of the state Assembly, Mr. Najeem Salaam and some other people prevailed on us to call off the strike.
