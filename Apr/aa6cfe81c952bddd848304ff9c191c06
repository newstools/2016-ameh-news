Nigerian telco Ntel has announced plans for its own LTE network. Lagos and Abuja will be covered first.  Ntel stated that it will be launching a 4G network covering Lagos and Abuja, which will go live this Friday. Ntel plans to widen network coverage as soon as these two cities’ networks are completed. The new network needs the approval of the Nigerian telecoms regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), however this is not seen as a problem and Ntel expects permission in the next few days. Ntel’s CEO, Ntel, Kamar Abass said that the company has already deployed 600 base transceiver stations in the two cities, with many more to be deployed to support the network as it expands. Abass said: “Ntel has deployed LTE-A with multi-antenna MIMO sites to improve download speeds. We are rolling out physical sites in three cities on our 900MHz and 1800MHz bands to launch Voice over LTE on April 8, 2016.” It is understood that 200 kilometres of fibre optic cables have been laid in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt to provide network connectivity. The company recently purchased all of the assets of the now defunct state-owned telco Nitel.
