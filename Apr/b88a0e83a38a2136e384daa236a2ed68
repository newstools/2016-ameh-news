(NAN) Reacting to downward market situation, Mr Ambrose Omordion, Chief Operating Officer, InvestData, attributed it to “bearish sentiments, lack of liquidity and the continued decline in the nation’s economic indices’’. Omordion said that lingering fuel scarcity and lack of electricity had pushed commodity prices high thereby making cost of living high in the country. He said that the recent downgrading of the economic growth to 2.3 per cent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to the current fiscal and monetary policies was affecting investors’ confidence.
