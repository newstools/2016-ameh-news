Kaduna — The Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai yesterday directed hospitals in the state to commence treatment of persons with gun wounds and those who are accident victims before demanding police reports. The directive is part of the decisions taken at the 15th Kaduna State Security Council meeting held in Sir Kashim Ibrahim House, Kaduna; the governor’s media aide, Samuel Aruwan disclosed in a statement. He said, “Lives must be saved first, before the formalities of demanding police reports from victims. After saving lives, hospitals and other agencies can start making inquiries regarding how the gunshot wounds and other injuries were sustained. We consider it a gross abdication of responsibility if any hospital leaves injured patients unattended because of the absence of Police reports. There is no reason for an innocent citizen who has survived armed robbery and needs treatment for a gunshot wound to be denied the medical attention he requires.”
