The Minister for Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola, said local investors will keep faith in Nigeria more than foreign investors. Fashola said foreign investors would naturally dumb an economy experiencing hard times while local companies remain since they are indigenous. He asked the states to partner local investors in their development plans and stop placing emphasis on foreign investments. The minister stated this yesterday at the Enugu State Investment Summit tagged: “Oganiru, with the theme “Beyond Oil: Fostering Inclusive Economic Growth & Sustainable Development”. The Enugu State Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, said that the summit would lay a new foundation for the development of Enugu State. He said: “Amongst other things, we are resuscitating our moribund industries while opening up new ones for the benefit of our people. I am excited that you all are a part of it.
