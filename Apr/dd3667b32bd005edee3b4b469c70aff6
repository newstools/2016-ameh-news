The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has admonished the Senate to jettison its ongoing effort to amend the laws regulating the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB, and the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT. NLC described the amendment as a legislative ambush targeted at scuttling the trial of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki. NLC’s call was contained in a statement by its president, Ayuba Wabba. Wabba said, “We at the Nigeria Labour Congress hold the view that the noble intention of the Senate notwithstanding, the timing is suspect and fraught with danger. “It is quite intriguing that it took the trial of the Senate President for the Senate to discover these flaws in the law(s). Putting it bluntly, in spite of the spirited defences by the Deputy Senate President to the contrary, not a few believe that this legislative move is a desperate attempt to scuttle the trial of the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, at CCT.”
