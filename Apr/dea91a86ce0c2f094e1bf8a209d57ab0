  At the resumed hearing of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki’s case, on the alleged false asset declaration, the Chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal, Danladi Yakubu Umar ordered all security agents in the courtroom bearing long fire arms to vacate the courtroom.  He also ordered individuals with camera devices, snapping video clips for mischievous reasons, to henceforth desist from it. He suggested that if having a broadcast media organizations for a live telecast of the proceedings is a needful option, for the public to view the proceedings, with a view to clear misconceptions, he would not hesitate to grant such permission after due consultation with both defense and prosecution counsels.The Chairman who gave the order in Abuja, inferred that the posting, via internet video clips did not reflect what transpired in the last adjourned date.  He opined that the video clip was mischievous, as it portrayed the Tribunal of not being fair to the defendant. Umar further assured that the Tribunal will uphold justice in its dealings with both parties. Subsequently, the Chairman entertained the hearing of the motion to excuse himself, filed by one of Dr. Saraki’s counsel, Ajibola Oluyede, with prolonged fierce argument between the litigants which preoccupied the entire day’s session.
