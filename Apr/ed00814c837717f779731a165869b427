UK Minister for International Development, Nick Hurd, has arrived in Nigeria on his first trip to the country. During his stay, Minister Hurd will focus on Britain’s assistance for the humanitarian situation in the northeast, as well the UK’s support for increasing the use of solar energy. Minister Hurd will also participate in a range of discussions with the Nigerian Government to emphasise the importance of good governance and accountability in ensuring poverty reduction. Minister Hurd will use part of his visit to focus on the humanitarian situation in the northeast and will explore what more can be done to protect civilians affected by conflict with Boko Haram. He will also meet with the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign at the end of their Global Week of Action. Over the course of the visit, Minister Hurd will also meet with industry representatives and business leaders to discuss the potential for large-scale business development in Nigeria, as well as innovative work on recycling and waste management that can improve the lives of poorer citizens. The Minister will view projects to witness the support the UK is giving to the development of Nigeria’s rapidly growing solar energy market. This forms part of the UK’s Energy Africa campaign, which aims to light up the African continent quickly without resorting to technology with high-emissions.
