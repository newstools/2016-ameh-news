The president of Citizens Watch Nigeria, CWN, Omoba Aigbegbele, has attacked Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity over his recent comment that the former Chief of Defence Staff, Alex Badeh, used the money given to him to buy weapons to build palaces in Abuja. Aigbegbele while reacting to Shehu’s claim said it was false and misleading, and as such there was no element of truth in his assertion. “This is a deliberately false and misleading statement by Mallam Garba Shehu which was calculated to tarnish the unblemished professional reputation of a distinguished professional, who has spent the better part of his life protecting and defending this country from external aggression and securing the territorial integrity of Nigeria,” Aigbegbele said in a statement issued on Monday. Shehu went beyond the charges against Badeh. There is not a single allegation in the charges against the former Chief of Defence Staff that he built palaces in Abuja with monies given to him to procure arms to secure his community. “Secondly, it is quite unimaginable of the Senior Special Assistant to use the scourge of the Boko Haram terrorist to score cheap political points, knowing full well that no one is exempted from the terrorists and their nefarious activities. Even President Buhari was also once attacked by the same group”, he said. Aigbegbele added that the presidential adviser may have forgotten that Section 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) created the sacred and constitutional doctrine of presumption of innocence. “It is, therefore, a matter of grave concern that he would make such unguarded pronouncements about a matter, which is currently sub judicial, and to which the former Chief of Defence Staff has pleaded ‘not guilty’.
