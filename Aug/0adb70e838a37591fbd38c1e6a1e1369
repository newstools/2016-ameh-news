A breakaway group of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Reformed Indigenous People of Biafra, RE-IPOB, has disclosed that it sacked the embattled leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu because he betrayed the struggle for Biafra.  Recall that the splinter group had last week, sacked Kanu as leader of the group, saying IPOB under him had become too rigid. The breakaway group had also registered its readiness to negotiate with the Federal Government in other to end the protracted struggle for the actualization of Biafra. RE-IPOB in a new statement by it’s spokesman, Ikemba Biafra, alleged that the detained Director of Radio Biafra, betrayed the struggle through collection of money from local and foreign sponsors. The group also accused Kanu of insulting respected Igbo leaders and converting the Radio Biafra set up by the leadership of the Movement for the Actualization Sovereign States of Biafra, MASSOB, to a private propaganda tool. According to RE-IPOB, the detained IPOB leader was not being sincere about the Biafra struggle, adding that he was using the platform to attract fortune and fame to himself. Warning that the Biafra movement was not a platform for political shenanigans, the breakaway group said, “The emergence of TRIPOB is a fall out of the internal wrangling in the IPOB. Members and officers of IPOB loyal to one of the spokesmen of IPOB, Emma Nmezu, are behind TRIPOB. There is nothing actually different between IPOB and TRIPOB. “This is why we wielded the big stick to sack them to save the Biafran struggle. We urge all pro-Biafra groups to remain calm and cease any contact with Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB or TRIPOB and await further information from RE-IPOB.” RE-IPOB further added that Kanu’s unguarded utterances led to the detention and death of innocent Igbo youths.
