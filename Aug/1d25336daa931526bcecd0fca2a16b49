Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Borno State, Hon Kaka Shehu Lawan on Tuesday accused former governor of the state, Alhaji Ali Modu Sherif of being the mastermind of Boko Haram.  He, therefore, called on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to arrest and prosecute the factional chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Vanguard reports that Lawal spoke at one of the sessions at the ongoing annual conference of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, in Port Harcourt. He said arrest of Sheriff over his alleged role in the emergence of Boko Haram will bring succor to those affected by actions of the Boko Haram sect. Lawan further alleged that Sheriff encouraged the spread of the Islamic terrorist group by financing its leaders.
