Leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, from southern Nigeria, have agreed to zone the National Chairmanship position of the party to the South-West geopolitical zone.  At a meeting attended by governors, National Assembly members and former ministers, and other leaders on Thursday, in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, the party leaders also agreed to zone the positions of national treasurer and deputy national publicity secretary to the South West. The leaders zoned the position of first deputy National Chairman, National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Woman Leader and Deputy National Auditor to the South-South. The South-East zone got the National Organising Secretary, National Youth Leader and Deputy National Financial Secretary. Addressing journalists at the end of the meeting, deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, said despite the zoning of the positions, any party member willing to contest any position was free to do so. By that arrangement, it appears the door has been locked against media mogul, Raymond Dokpesi, and the immediate past acting National chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus, who both signified their intention to contest. Those likely to emerge as the next chairman of the party include former Chairman of the Nigerian Port Authority, Bode George, former Ogun state governor, Gbenga Daniel, and the partyâ€™s governorship flag bearer for Lagos state in 2015, Jimi Agbaje. The PDP is expected to hold its national convention to elect a new set of leaders on August 17 in Port Harcourt, Rivers state.
