A magistrate court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State on Wednesday, remanded a lawyer, Mr. Daniel Ndata, in prison for alleged issuance of a dishonoured (dud) cheque of N1.6m. Ndata was accused of issuing the dud cheque to a financial institution, Pay Mega Bank Ltd. The presiding magistrate, Mr. Usukama Akpabio, while delivering judgment in the matter, stated that the offence was contrary to Section 1 of the Dishonoured Cheque Offences Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004. Akpabio directed that the case file should be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. Meanwhile, the accused person was remanded in the prison pending the advice of the DPP. The case entitled, ‘‘The Commissioner of Police vs Samuel Ndata’’ has been adjourned till Monday, January 9, 2017. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mega Pay Nigeria Limited, Mr. Johnson Offuo, claimed that the accused, who had been in law practice for 28 years, took a loan from the bank in January 24, 2015 and promised to pay back within two months (March 24, 2015). He said, “After the expiration of the agreement, he was nowhere to be found. If you call him, he would tell you he was in Abuja and even the house he staked as a condition could not be accessed because of wild dogs he kept in the place. “All our efforts to make him pay the money proved abortive, even as we discovered that the house he presented as collateral had been sold. Along the line, it was the person who signed as his surety that we used to track him. “We later decided to go to court and the magistrate had ruled that he does not have jurisdiction in the case, that is why he (Ndata) was remanded in prison, while the case file was sent to the DPP for further advice.”
