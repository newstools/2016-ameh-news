Access into the National Assembly this morning is an Herculean task as all three entry gates have been shut by security operatives. The action is preparatory to President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s anticipated visit to the National Assembly today to present the estimates of the 2017 budget to senators and members of the House of Representatives. Members of staff have been denied access and all other organisations rendering services within the complex have been shut out. Long queues of vehicles and crowds of anxious people are noticed along the entry points. Source: http://punchng.com/breaking-11-4/
