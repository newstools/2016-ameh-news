Six months after the presidency sent the name of the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, to the Senate for confirmation, the parliament has finally resolved to screen the EFCC boss thursday. Announcing Magu’s screening wednesday, the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who presided over the plenary, said other board members of the anti-graft agency would also be screened.
The board members are Nasule Moses, Lawan Maman, Garandaji Imam Naji and Adeleke Adebayo Rafiu.
Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had on June 17, 2016, while serving as Acting President, sent Magu’s name to the Senate for confirmation. But indication that the Senate was not favourably disposed towards his confirmation arose when in an unusual manner, Senate President Bukola Saraki failed to read the letter until July 14, three weeks after.
Whereas many had believed that having eventually had his letter read, screening and confirmation would also follow, it was unknown to them that it would only amount to the beginning of Magu’s longer wait. However, there were insinuations that besides Senate’s apparent unwillingness to screen and confirm Magu, there are other forces in the Presidential Villa who have an axe to grind with him and want him stopped by all means.
Nevertheless, his screening today will not amount to automatic confirmation until he is finally proclaimed to have been confirmed indeed.
