Experts have faulted the legal framework guiding infrastructure development in the country. Speaking at the closing of a two-day colloquium organised by the Centre for Ethics and Sustainable Development held at the University of Lagos on Friday, they argued that for Public-Private Partnership to work for infrastructure delivery in Nigeria, there must be an urgent review of the existing legal framework. The theme of the forum was: ‘Reshaping the Infrastructure Delivery Landscape for Sustainable Development in Nigeria’. The experts added that there was a need to address adaptive and social challenges, effective communication and stakeholder management as well as gender and social inclusion to enhance PPP in the country. Lagos-based legal practitioner, Mr. Babatunde Ogala, who argued that most of the country’s existing infrastructural development laws were outdated, said legislative decisions that prevent development and implementation of policies should be amended in order to achieve a sustainable legal framework for infrastructure delivery in the country. According to him, security, law and order are key items that ensure good delivery of infrastructural projects, adding that a holistic approach to reshaping infrastructure delivery was essential.
