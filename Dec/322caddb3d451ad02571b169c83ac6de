President Muhammadu Buhari tuesday signed eight bills into law. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Ita Enang, disclosed this yesterday while speaking with State House correspondents in Abuja. The bills are: National Judicial Institute Amendment Bill 2016; Advertising Practitioners Registration Amendment Bill, 2016; Utilities Charges Commission Amendment Bill 2016; Quality Surveyors Registration Amendment Bill 2016; and Small and Medium Scale Industries Development Agency Amendment Bill, 2016. Others are Treaty to Establish African Economic Community Relating to Pan African Parliament (Accession and Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill 2016; University of Abuja Amendment Bill 2016, and Chartered Institute of Stock Brokers Amendment Bill 2016. Enang also raised the hope that the appropriation bill, currently awaiting consideration by the National Assembly, would be treated with dispatch immediately the lawmakers resume from new year break on January 10. Enang said: “These are bills transmitted to the president, having been assented to by him have become Acts enforceable in Nigeria. “I use this medium to commend members of National Assembly for the industry and dexterity they have shown and the concentration on the core functions of the legislature because compared to times like this in previous assemblies, I think this is the highest number of bills passed by any single assembly within its one year and six months.” He also commended the leadership of the National Assembly for the cooperation extended to the executive.
