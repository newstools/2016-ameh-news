There is palpable fear at the Federal Prison, Owerri, Imo State, over the escape of two inmates of the prison who are still serving jail terms. According to a staff member of the prison, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, the inmates escaped from the prison by scaling the fence. He said, “The escapees took the advantage of the ongoing building construction in the male section of the facility to abscond. “I believe that the plan was hatched by the male inmates who were working at the construction site. “Their escape has caused serious panic in the prison. There are fears that heads will roll if the convicts are not found. They scaled the fence, while work was going on in the male section of the prison. We believe that most of the male prisoners planed and facilitated the escape.” It was gathered that the prison authorities had launched  an investigation into the cause of the escape. Efforts to get the reaction of the state prison command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP James Madugba, proved abortive as a text message sent to his mobile phone had yet to be replied to as of press time.
