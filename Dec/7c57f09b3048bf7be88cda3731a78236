Hoodlums suspected to be cattle rustlers have gruesomely murdered a Fulani herdsman and stole two of his cows around Emu-Ebendo community, Ndokwa-West Local Government Area of Delta state. The incident, which occurred last Friday, reportedly generated apprehension between herdsmen and residents of the area following the discovery of the corpse pinned down in a shallow river by a large trunk to prevent it from floating. A security source, who was among the rescue team who recovered the remains of the late herdsman from the river, identified the victim as Haruna Mohammed, adding that security had been beefed up in the area to prevent reprisal from the Fulani community in the state. Our correspondent learnt that the rustlers shot the herdsman repeatedly before throwing him into the river. The suspects thereafter shot and slaughtered two cows belonging to the victim at an uncompleted petrol station in the community. The source said, “The herdsman was attacked on Friday evening by the rustlers while trying to steal his cows when he resisted them. They were two herdsmen that went for the grazing but one of them went to buy food, before he returned his colleague had been killed. “It took us two days before we could discover the corpse tied to a heavy wood inside the river. We traced him to the river bank after his colleagues waited for his return on Friday. The next day (Saturday), his colleague reported the case at police station in Abbi.” The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the killing when contacted on Monday.
