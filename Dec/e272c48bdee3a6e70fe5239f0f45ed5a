The expansion drive of BUA Cement, which commenced last year, will be completed in 2018, the Executive Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, BUA Group, Abdulsamad Rabiu, has said. He described cement production as a challenging business, but noted that despite the harsh operating environment, the company would continue to meet the aspirations of its stakeholders. At the event, the company gave out millions of naira to its customers, including cars and other valuable items, for their loyalty to the brand. Raabiu said, “This award is our little way of celebrating you as you have been with us constantly throughout the year. Your loyalty to the brand has helped us to grow and we will continue to celebrate customers who have been there in this period of economic crisis. “We have embarked on an expansion drive and this will be completed in 2018. Cement business is a very challenging one, because it is a capital intensive business; but I want to assure you that our expansion project will be completed by the end of next year or at the beginning of 2018.” The Acting Managing Director of the company, Mr. Yusuf Benji, said that despite the challenging operating environment, the company would not compromise on the issue of quality of its products. “Our watchword is quality. Anybody that knows our products can attest to the high level of quality that it has and that is not going to be compromised. We are going to give Nigerians value for their money,” he stated Source: http://punchng.com/bua-targets-eight-million-metric-tonnes-cement/
