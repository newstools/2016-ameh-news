The Turkish military on Friday said that it had assumed power over Turkey, in what the prime minister has termed an illegal act.  “The power in the country has been seized in its entirety,” said a military statement read on NTV television, without giving further details. The military‘s website was not immediately accessible. The Turkish military had earlier said that it had launched a coup on Friday. Soldiers were seen on the streets in Istanbul and Ankara as jets flew low overhead, while ordinary citizens rushed for the safety of their homes after witnessing the coup attempt. “The power in the country has been seized in its entirety,” said a military statement quoted by Turkish media. It said the move had been made “in order to ensure and restore constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms and let the supremacy law in the country prevail, to restore order which was disrupted.” “All our international agreements and commitments retain their validity. We hope our good relations will continue with all countries in the world.”
