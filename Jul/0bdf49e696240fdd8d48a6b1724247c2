Some youths in the Ondo State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party have kicked against the alleged plan of the state governor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, to impose a candidate from the Ondo Central Senatorial District in the November 26, governorship election.  The youths under the auspices of North/South Senatorial Youths Campaigners, alleged that the governor had it in plan to impose the Incumbent Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice of the state, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, as governorship candidate of the party. The PDP youths in a statement issued on Tuesday by their leader, Mr. Dele Ayeni, accused the leadership of the party of working for a faction of the All Progressives Congress in order to deliver the state to the opposition. They alleged that the governor was planning to present a weakling to the electorate so that the PDP would be easily defeated in the forthcoming governorship election. In the statement, the NSSYC said  both Senate President, Dr.  Bukola Saraki and former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubarkar were in support of the candidacy of Jegede so as to have their way in Ondo State in the 2019 presidential election in the country. The statement read, ” This is a clarion call to party members of conscience,  particularly the leader, political office holders and delegates to put the survival of the party above personal interest by doing what is right. “This is to make sure that power shifts either to the North or South Senatorial Districts of the state as the case maybe. Most of our leaders, once they get to power get disconnected from grassroots making them take decisions that produce total failure at the polls.
