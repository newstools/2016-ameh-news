Kogi State women have demanded apology from Oluremi Tinubu, wife of former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu for calling their son, Dino Melaye a dog. Mrs. Tinubu and Melaye have been in the news over a recent squabble during senate plenary. Kogi State women in a press conference on Tuesday asked Mrs. Tinubu to apologise to Melaye for allegedly calling their illustrious son a ‘dog’. According to the women, it was unbecoming of Mrs. Tinubu, who was supposed to be a role model to women across the country to insult somebody else’s man just because they were colleagues. The women, also printed banners with words like “Remi Tinubu must apologize to Dino Melaye” and “Lagos is not superior to Kogi” and “Kogi Women support Dino Melaye” among others.
