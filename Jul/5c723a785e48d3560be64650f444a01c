The All Progressives Congress (APC) Southern Senatorial District Youths in Ondo State have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently constitute board members for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The youths spoke through their senatorial youth leader, Mr. Soji Ogungbeni, to reporters shortly after their monthly meeting held in Okitipupa local government.
The youth leader blamed resuscitation of militancy in the Niger Delta region as the failure of the present administration to constitute the NDDC board.
Ogungbeni expressed optimism that if the government put the board in place, it would help to arrest the scourge of militants’ activities in the region.
The APC chieftain noted that “the President must understand that his failure to constitute the NDDC board has drawn the Niger Delta, which Ondo southern senatorial district is part of backwards.
“We the youths in APC believe that putting the board in place would fast track development and also help to curb the resuscitation of militant activities in the region.
“The President must understand that the Niger Delta areas lay the gold egg and issues affecting these areas must be given a special attention.
“We the youths from the Niger Delta areas believe in this present administration and we also believe that we are in safe hand.”
However, he commended the President for appointing the APC South West Vice-Chairman, Chief Pius Akinyelure as a member of NNPC.
