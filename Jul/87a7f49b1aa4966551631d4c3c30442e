The Nigeria Immigration Service, NIS, Ebonyi State Command on Wednesday intercepted an 18-seater bus conveying suspected victims of human trafficking including underage children.  The bus was intercepted en-route Edo State from Bekwara in Cross River state. The State Acting Comptroller of NIS, Barrister Okey Ezugwu, who confirmed the report to newsmen at the Command Headquarters in Abakaliki, said the bus with registration number Lagos LDD-468XH with the emblem of ‘Ondo State Sunshine Express’ boldly written on it had 18 passengers travelling in it. Ezugwu stated that upon interrogation, the victims reported that they were going to Ondo while some were sent to Benin to work in a Cocoa plantation. The Comptroller stressed that human trafficking was a violation and an abuse of child rights for minors. While expressing displeasure at the harsh life and inhumane treatment the victims would have been subjected to working on a cocoa farm, Ezugwu said the children had no business going on the trip without being escorted by their parents. He, however, urged parents to desist from the terrible habit of giving their children out to strangers for monetary and material gains.
