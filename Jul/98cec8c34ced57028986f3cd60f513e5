A Federal High Court in Owerri, Imo State, has dismissed forgery charges against Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State. The court cleared Ikpeazu of forgery charges, saying his tax documents were not forged as alleged, adding that he remains governor.
One of the governorship aspirants in the December 2014 governorship primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr. FridayNwosu, had filed a tax forgery suit against Ikpeazu.
Nwosu prayed the court to declare him the partyâ€™s rightful candidate and governor of the state.
This comes less than two weeks after Justice Okon Abang of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered Ikpeazu to vacate office for submitting false information to his party, the PDP for the governorship primaries.
Justice Abang had also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to immediately issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff, Uche Ogah, who polled the second highest number of votes in the primary.
Ikpeazu has, however, since appealed the ruling.
