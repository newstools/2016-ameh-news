The Controller-General of the Federal Fire Service , Mr Joseph Anebi, has debunked rumours of an ongoing recruitment by the service.  Speaking in a statement signed by Mr Elechi Collins of the corporate services unit of the organisation in Abuja on Wednesday, Anebi said “the attention of the Controller-General, Federal Fire Service, has been drawn to the rumours that there is an ongoing recruitment in the organisation. “This is not true, and therefore, we are using this platform to caution the general public and the youths, in particular, to be careful of whom they are dealing with. “The warning is necessary lest they be caught in the web and fall preys to criminals who are bent on tarnishing the agency’s image by swindling unsuspected youths through the said recruitment,” he said. Anebi said that the recruitment was not only false but unfounded and could never be as there was a process the service must go through to actualise recruitment. He said the service could only recruit after it must have been given approval by the relevant and necessary authorities. Anebi warned that anyone caught would be dealt with in accordance with the law.
