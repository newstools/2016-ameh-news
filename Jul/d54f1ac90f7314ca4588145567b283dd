The Cross River State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has called for the impeachment of the State Governor, Ben Ayade over alleged breach of constitutional matters.  Chairman of the state chapter of the party, Mr John Ochala in a press briefing in Calabar, the state capital gave reasons why Ayade should be impeached. According to Ochala, the state governor among many other reasons, stayed away from the state longer than what the constitution prescribed without handing over to his deputy. Ochala said, “If the House of Assembly do not find any area for which to indict and consequently impeach Ayade, we wish to point to them that the governor has consistently stayed out of the state for a period longer than what the constitution prescribes, without duly transmitting the reins of governance to his deputy as prescribed by the relevant statutes. “Also, he has acted contrary to the provisions laid out in the second schedule of the constitution by attempting to, among others, create a police force in the guise of Green Police, Homeland Security which are in the exclusive preserve of the Federal Government.”
