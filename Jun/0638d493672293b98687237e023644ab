 Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello was on Thursday stopped from traveling to Saudi Arabia for a lesser hajj at Malam Aminu Kano International Airport as his travel visa had expired.
According to SaharaReporters, the governor had boarded the Saudi Arabia bound aircraft and sat on his reserved seat while his aides were busy processing his travel documents only to â€Ždiscover that his visa has expired. Shortly after the discovery of the expired visa on his passport, the visibly disappointed governor had no alternative but to disembark from the aircraft.
Thereafter, it was gathered that Mr. Bello proceeded to the Kano State Government House, where he spent the night.
