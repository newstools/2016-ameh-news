The immediate past National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples
Democratic Party( PDP), Chief Olisa Metuh on Thursday said he was
prepared to pay back  his share of N400million out of the $2.1billion
cash meant for arms. The cash was allegedly diverted to political purposes by the Office of
the National Security Adviser( ONSA) during the tenure of ex-National
Security Adviser( NSA).
But Metuh, who has been on trial in the past few months, said he has
had enough of legal travails.
He said he had been in talks with the Ministry of Justice, the EFCC
and other necessary bodies on how to refund the money and resolve the
issue.
The ex-PDP National Publicity Secretary came up with the offer in a
statement through his counsel, Onyechi Ikpeazu (SAN).
He said although the cash was released to him by former President
Goodluck Jonathan, he did not know the source as at the time.
He said since the EFCC presented a document on the source of the money
in court, he had made up his mind to willingly refund the N400million.
He said: ” It was however while in court that a document was brought
regarding the source of the money and since then, our Client has made
manifest his willingness to refund the money and has indeed approached
his family, friends and associates to mobilise funds to refund the
entire N400 million to the government regardless of the fact that the
money had been expended based on the directives of the former
President and that part of the money had been recovered from one of
the prosecution witnesses.”
