 President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration would rebuild Nigeria, including the Niger Delta region.
He, therefore, solicited patience and understanding from the citizenry. Receiving a delegation of Niger Delta Dialogue and Contact Group, led by His Royal Highness, King Alfred Diette-Spiff, the Amanyanabo of Twon Brass, Bayelsa State, at State House, Abuja, Thursday, President Buhari pledged that under his watch, Nigeria will witness judicious utilization of resources.
“We intend to rebuild this country; so that our children and grand-children will have a good place they can call their own. A lot of damage has been done, so I want you to tell the people to be patient. “When you get together with other leaders, please pacify the people. We will utilize the resources of Nigeria with integrity and rebuild the country.” The President said the gazette on the Niger Delta amnesty programme by the Umaru Yar’Adua administration was being studied with a view to determining what had been fulfilled, promising that whatever was left would equally be addressed. “I want to get as much intelligence as possible on the situation in the Niger Delta. I have encouraged law enforcement agencies to contact leaders like you in order to have enough information to deal with the issues once and for all,” the President said.
He sympathized with investors who borrowed lots of money to invest in the Niger Delta region but had not recouped their investments due to insecurity. He used the occasion of his audience with the group to reiterate his appeal to those who perpetrated violence to embrace peace and give government a chance. The leader of the Group, King Alfred Diette-Spiff, said the group was made up of peace builders, dedicated to peace and stability in the region.
