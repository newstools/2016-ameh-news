 The former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to stop causing more problems for the country but set out modalities for solving the many problems caused by the All Progressives Congress, APC administration. In a statement issued in Abuja, on Wednesday, Prince Secondus said what the President Buhari-led government has done in the last one year was  creating more battle fronts and compounding the challenges of the county. Buhari “Today under APC leadership the country has become a whole theatre of acrimony with agitations here and there with no clear sign of solution in sight forcing political watchers to question if the country is disintegrating. “Even the Boko Haram issue that was supposed to be progressing well has run into troubled waters because of the confusion in the ruling party. “Ditto the federal Government’s anti corruption fight is even skewed due to insincerity as Ministers already confirmed to be corrupt internationally continue to move untouched while Governors with immunity are harassed daily. “Rather than confront the various challenges overwhelming the country, APC is currently bleeding soaked in its own greed and the obvious consequence is that a house divided against itself is bound to fall and the party is already falling” he pointed. Prince Secondus said under Buhari’s watch, all indices of democratic principles, especially those anchored on the rule of law and separation of power have been eroded. He said Nigerians are living in fear because  of the “draconian system of our operatives who come after them for airing their views.” The PDP chieftain decried what he called the “ongoing attempt to humiliate and intimidate the National Assembly,” pointing that “as representatives of the people, the National Assembly remains the only bastion of democracy in the country.”
