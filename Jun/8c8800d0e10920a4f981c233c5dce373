 The Defence Headquarters on Monday said Boko Haram militants now disguise as vigilante members and hunters to evade the military. The Defence Spokesman, Brig. Gen. Rabe Abubakar, said the military discovered the Boko Haram militants’ latest antics during a coordinated offensive against remnants of the terrorists in Sambisa forest. He said, “The fleeing terrorists now disguise as vigilantes or hunters to evade easy detection. The terrorists, after they have been smoked out of Sambisa forest and in their desperation to wreak havoc on innocent Nigerians and to remain relevant, devised a new tactics of dressing like vigilantes or hunters to deceive unsuspecting members of the public on their true identity. “The case of Kuda-Kaya Village in Madadali community of Adamawa State where a group of Boko Haram terrorists, dressed like vigilantes, opened fire on elated people during a ceremony readily come to mind. The general public is hereby advised to be wary of unsubscribed services or presence of vigilantes or hunters in their neighbourhood in order not to ignorantly harbour killer gang in their midst.”
