 The  Chairman of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has said the ongoing refinery project in Lekki area of Lagos which was earlier projected to cost N2.8trillion would now be completed at the cost of N4.8trillion due to the prevailing forex policy in the country, Daily Trust reports. He also revealed the impact of the new foreign exchange policy on the project saying that “we lost almost N50 billion to new forex regime.’’ “ Every single kobo we make in the country is ploughed back into the economy. I don’t have a single block outside Nigeria, I am a proud Nigerian and I believe in this country,’’ he said. He spoke weekend in Lagos during the tour of the facility by the Vice President Yemi  Osinbajo, where he also said he was committed to the multi-billion dollar project to aid the nation’s economy despite the development. He said that contrary to speculations, the company had not gotten substantial forex from the Central Bank of Nigeria.
