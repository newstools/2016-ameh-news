 Heavily armed security agents on Wednesday, halted a procession by members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, in Katsina. Daily Trust reports that members of the sect had gathered at the Central Mosque area to begin the procession at about 8am when armed security personnel moved in to disperse them. The security agents then moved in a convoy round the main streets of the town. The foiled Sayyada Zahara Maulud procession is an annual event by the movement to commemorate the birth of the prophet’s daughter, Fatima. The leader of the movement in Katsina, Shiek Yakubu Yahaya, recalled that about 10 vehicles full of armed security personnel arrived the venue, confiscating banners and flags of the sect which sent fears among followers. Confirming the development, Shiites’ spokesman, Ibrahim Musa, said on noticing the number of soldiers that surrounded the main Juma’at mosque where the procession was to take off, the movement relocated to prevent any confrontation.
