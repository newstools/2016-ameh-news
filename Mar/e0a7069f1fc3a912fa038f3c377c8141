  Garba Shehu, spokesman to President Muhammadu Buhari has given the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, a 72-hour ultimatum to withdraw its statement accusing him of illegally dealing in
forex. Shehu demanded an apology from the opposition party for the accusation levelled against him or he would constitute a legal action against the party. It was learnt that Shehu through his lawyers, Cherish Solicitors having verified that the twitter that carried the claim, @PDPNigeria, is the official handle of the PDP, wrote to the PDP national chairman, Ali Modu Sheriff, demanding a letter of apology and a retraction of the publication within 72 hours. “We shall be left with no option than to have recourse to our client’s rights under the law. “We condemn your defamatory and libellous actions in the strongest terms and we state that this is least expected from an organization of your standing which produced past and present crops of leaders, expected to be role model in the country,” stated the letter, signed by Aliyu Abdullahi. PDP had through its twitter handle @PDPNigeria, alleged that Shehu bought USD800, 000 from the Central Bank of Nigeria at official rate, and sold it off the same day at black market rate. This Shehu had denied saying “The day I choose to start trading in FOREX I will resign as a presidential spokesman”.
