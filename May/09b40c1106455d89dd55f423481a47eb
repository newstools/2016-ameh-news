The House of Representatives on Thursday urged the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Solomon Arase, to immediately re-seal the Kogi State House of Assembly pending the resolution of its crisis. The reseal order followed the recommendation of the ad hoc committee constituted by the house to reassess the assembly’s impasse. The committee which had the Majority Leader of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila as Chairman, recommended for the reprimand of the IGP for undermining the authority of the legislature by unsealing the assembly recently. The house resolved that all resolutions, laws and actions taken by the Kogi assembly from the date of the National Assembly’s resolution to seal it were null and void. “The Governor of Kogi State is to send the state budget and other executive bills to the National Assembly for consideration as stipulated in section 11 of the Constitution,“ the representatives said. The lawmakers described the actions of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Arase as an affront on the legislature and the country’s democracy by ordering the reopening of the assembly without recourse to the house. Gbajabiamila dismissed the Attorney-General’s submissions that any matter in court could not be discussed on the floor of the house.
