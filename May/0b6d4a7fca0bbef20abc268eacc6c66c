LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) — Nigerian troops operating in oil rich Niger Delta on Wednesday said its personnel killed four suspected pirates, during a surveillance patrol along the Ogbia – Nembe waterways in Bayelsa State. The shootout occurred at the same place where a Lebanese construction worker was abducted and two soldiers killed by gunmen in April. Spokesperson for the Joint military force in Niger Delta, Col. Ado Isa, who confirmed the incident, said four of the hoodlums were hit by the troops’ bullets and feared dead on Monday. Isa said the troops were on patrol of the waterways when they saw the hoodlums between Peregbene and Obama area of the state. The spokesperson said the suspected pirates were using a speedboat with 200 horse power engine, which had been banned in the state’s waterways. Ado said the Commander of the Operation Pulo Shield, Maj.-Gen. Alani Okunlola, had ensured regular patrol of the waterways to fish out economic saboteurs and other maritime criminals in the Niger Delta region.
