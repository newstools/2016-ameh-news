 NEW YORK: Brent crude rose to a six-month high, leading a rebound in commodities and boosting the stocks from the US to developing markets, as supply disruptions in Nigeria added to production woes. Oil extended last week’s gains past $47 a barrel as Goldman Sachs Group increased its price forecast, saying the market had moved into a supply deficit earlier than expected. The S&P 500 Index’s advance was led by energy producers, while Apple rose after Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake. Precious metals rallied with aluminium and commodity producers climbed, while almost all of the other industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell. The pickup in raw-materials prices is providing some support for global equities after about $1.8 trillion was wiped off the value of the securities in the first two weeks of May amid weaker economic data and disappointing earnings reports. Brent rose 2.6 per cent to $49.09 a barrel at 11:10am in New York, reaching the highest since November. China’s refineries processed crude at record rates in April, helping ease a supply glut as the number of active rigs in the US declines. West Texas Intermediate climbed 2.6 per cent to $47.42. Goldman Sachs raised its oil-price forecast for the second half to $50, from a March estimate of $45. Stocks The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent, rebounding from a third weekly decline, its longest streak since January. A report by the New York Federal Reserve showed an index that tracks manufacturing activity in the state declined unexpectedly. Apple jumped after Buffett’s Nebraska company disclosed a stake in the tech giant worth more than $1 billion at the end of the first quarter. Yahoo rose as people familiar with the matter saidBuffett is backing a group bidding for the company’s Internet assets. Improved economic data in the US prompted speculation that a boost to interest rates this year, and possibly even as soon as next month, just became more likely.
