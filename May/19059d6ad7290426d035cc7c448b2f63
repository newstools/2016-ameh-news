 Mr Government Ekpemupolo, (aka Tompolo), ex-Niger Delta militant leader, said on Monday that he was not part of the new group blowing up oil facilities in the region. Ekpemuopolo stated this in a signed statement mailed electronically to newsmen in Warri, Delta. The embattled Gbaramatu chieftain dissociated himself from the new militant group, the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA). He described as unfortunate, the continuous military siege on Gbaramatu Kingdom, Warri South West Local Government Area. He said there was no need for military siege on Gbaramatu because he had nothing to do with the NDA. “It baffles me that the Nigerian military has refused to believe that I am not part of the group and its activities. “I am obviously a victim of circumstance in this matter because of my case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC),’’ he said. Ekpemuopolo said it was irrational for him to resort to destruction of oil facilities because of the charges against him by the EFCC. He said some people gave the government wrong information to the effect that he was behind the new group, the Niger Delta Avengers. “May I once again point out that those accusing me of the destruction of oil facilities in part of Delta are simply looking for relevance, recognition and pipeline surveillance contracts,’’ he said. He urged the Federal Government to be mindful of the information it gets, noting that some persons were doing that for selfish gain. Ekpemuopolo urged the Federal Government to launch a thorough investigation to ascertain those behind the new group. (NAN)
