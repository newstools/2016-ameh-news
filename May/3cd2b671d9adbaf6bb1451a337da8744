 Principal witness in the ongoing case involving the Senate President, Bukola Saraki at the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT, Michael Wetkas, on Wednesday revealed how the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, found evidence linking Saraki to a property he did not declare interest in during a search of his company’s premises.
Wetkas, an operative of the EFCC while reading count 6 of the charges accused the Senate President of not declaring his interest in a plot on 37a, Global Road, Ikoyi Lagos in his asset declaration. The witness said evidence linking Saraki to the property was found during a search carried out at the office of the Chairman of Carlye Properties, a company the Senate President owned.
Responding to a question by Saraki’s lawyer, Paul Usoro, SAN, on how the commission came about the conclusion that Saraki had interest in the property, Wetkas said, “We invited the MD of Carlye properties and he promised to come but never came. “This made us to execute a search warrant at his office and we found a list of properties of the defendant
and that is where we recovered the information.” Wetkas further explained to the tribunal that the commission did not accuse Saraki of owning the property because some other people came up claiming to own the same property. The Chairman of the tribunal, Danladi Umar, however, adjourned the matter till next week Wednesday.
