 The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Edo State Chapter has declared indefinite strike in the state. The workforce said it will begin an indefinite strike on Wednesday, despite the industrial court order, restraining them from protesting the fuel price hike. It described the court ruling as a black market injunction and urged its members and members of the civil society organizations not to succumb to threats in some quarters. The state chairman of the NLC, Emmanuel Ademokun, disclosed this while briefing journalists at the state secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Benin City. Ademokun said, “That order was a black market injunction and we are not going to abide by it. “The strike will commence on Wednesday. “As regard the Industrial court, we have never respected the order. The court restrained us from using the stadium. Oshiomhole was then the leader. We are going ahead to implement the strike and a directive has already been given from the national headquarters that the strike commences on Wednesday. There is no going back,” he stated.
