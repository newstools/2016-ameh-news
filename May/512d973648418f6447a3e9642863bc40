The Civil Society Network Against Corruption (CSNAC) has petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate an alleged gross abuse of contracts and awards in the Ministry of Aviation. In a petition forwarded to the office of the EFCC chairman and signed by CSNAC’s national chairman, Olanrewaju Suraj, the group also requested an investigation into alleged financial recklessness and theft in the ministry. The petition reads, “We are in receipt of a petition from the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) wherein the organization informed us of the financial recklessness, duplication of contract figures, and abuse of due process in the award of contracts perpetrated by the former Minister of Aviation, Princess Stella Oduah, in what she termed “Phase 1 of Airport Remodeling Exercise,” which included the rehabilitation of terminal buildings in the 11 airports in the country. “It is worthy of note that such corrupt activities have not only affected our economy negatively but also have adverse effects on the aviation industry. It also affects the safety of passengers patronizing the aviation industry in Nigeria as well as the welfare of staff and other stakeholders in the sector,” the petition said. The coalition attached documents to substantiate its aforementioned claims and said it is requesting that the EFCC conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged corrupt practices as well as the prosecution of all individuals who were involved in the chain of activities that constitute sabotage on the Nigerian economy.
