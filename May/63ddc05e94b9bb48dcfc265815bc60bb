 Residents of Kwara state have rejected the new price regime of petrol at N145 per liter announced by the federal government. They advised the government to revert to the old price of N86.50 per litre without further delay. Also on Thursday, some of the fuel stations that had been closed for almost three months now under the pretence that there was no fuel opened for business for the motorists due to the increase in the petrol price to N145 per liter. A visit by our correspondent‎ to some of the independent fuel stations located along Offa-Garage, Eiyenkorin, Shango, Post office, Asa dam axis, showed that they were opened for business. Some of the residents who spoke with THISDAY on the new price regime described it as callous, wicked and undemocractic. A trader at Oja- Tuntun markte, Ilorin, Alhaja Aisat Oloruntoyin said,”We are not expecting this kind of hardship under the government of President Muhammadu Buhari because he did not promise us this kind of hardship”. She said: “We came out en masse during the last general election to vote for a change but this is not the kind of hardship we voted for”.
