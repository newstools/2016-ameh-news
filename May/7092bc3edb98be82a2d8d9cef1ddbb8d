Ebonyi State governor, Chief David Umahi has ordered the State Commissioner of Police, CP Peace Ibekwe Abdallah to flush out all herdsmen who settled in the premises of the State University within seven days. The governor, who gave the directive in Abakaliki during the Agric Summit organised by the state government to boost rice production in the state, said the university environment was no place for nomadic herdsmen. The governor, however, opposed the calls for a reprisal attack on Fulani herdsmen in the South East zone over the brutal killing of over 30 persons in Ukpabi Nimbo, Uzo-Uwani local government area of Enugu State by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Umahi insisted that waging a war against the Fulani herdsmen would have grave implications. “Hausa-Fulani community in Ebonyi State has a long history of peaceful and harmonious settlement and have not been implicated in any criminal activity. “But those who are nomadic should be allowed to pass through Ebonyi, provided they do so peacefully, without causing harm to people or destruction of crops in Ebonyi. “Those who are settled in the premises of the university must quietly and peacefully be evicted by the Commissioner of Police because the university environment is no place for nomadic herdsmen,” Umahi said.
