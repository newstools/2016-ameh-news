President Muhammadu Buhari, Thursday, in Abuja, said the process of recovering Nigerian stolen funds had become monotonous. The President stated this while receiving the Executive Secretary of United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, Yury Fedotov. According to him, the process had “become tedious” to the consternation of Nigerians. He enjoined the UN agency to facilitate faster recovery of the stolen wealth stocked overseas. “We are looking for more cooperation from the EU, United States, other countries and international institutions to recover the nation’s stolen assets, particularly proceeds from the stolen crude oil,” the President was quoted in a statement issued by Garba Shehu, his spokesman. “It is taking very long and Nigerians are becoming impatient,” he added. Buhari told Fedotov that his government had worked very hard in the past 11 months to reverse the very negative global perception of Nigeria. He said, “Our genuine efforts to deal with corruption and drugs have earned us international respect and this has encouraged us to do more. “We know that by fighting the scourge of drugs and corruption and rebuilding trustworthiness, integrity, good business practices and imposing discipline on youths to avoid drugs, we are not doing a favour to the international community; we are doing a favour to ourselves,” he added. On his part, Fedotov told Buhari that UNODC had chosen Nigeria as a pilot country for support and cooperation in the fight against drugs and corruption.
