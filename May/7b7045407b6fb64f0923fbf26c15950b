For allegedly abandoning N700million Dugwaba Water Dam project in Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State in the North Eastern Nigeria, federal lawmaker representing Gombi/Hong Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Yusuf Buba Yakubu, has called for the sanctioning of the the Upper Benue River Basin Development Authority and the prosecution of contractors handling the project. While speaking with DAILY POST in Abuja, Buba accused management of Upper Benue River Basin Development Authority of complicity in the failed contract despite the fact that contractors handling the project have been mobilised to the tune of N333million. He further explained that additional N25million was released to the land owners by government, but regretted that only N1million got to them. I can confirm to you that the sum of N333million was paid through the Upper Basin Development Authority, representing 45%, to contractors, but as I speak to you there is nothing on ground”, he said. “Also they only paid N1million of the sum of N25million released by the federal government to land owners,” he added. He expressed concern over the refusal of the River Basin management to attend Public Hearings for two consecutive times without explanations, pointing out that the era of impunity has gone. While giving his support to the House Committee on Public Petitions’ decision to compel the management of Upper Benue River Basin Development Authority to attend a rescheduled public hearing on the project, he warned that the Managing Director of the agency risks warrant of arrest if he refused to attend without any cogent reasons again. “I want to commend the House Committee on Public Petitions for compelling their attendance to Public Hearings at a rescheduled date and I want to say if they refuse to come and explain what they know, they will risk warrant of arrest,” Buba maintained.
