 The South West zonal congress of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, scheduled for tomorrow has being cancelled by the party’s national leadership. Speaking with the Punch on Friday in Abuja, the National Secretary of the party, Professor Wale Oladipo said the party was recalling its officers already sent to Akure, the Ondo State capital, venue of the congress. He said the decision to stop the congress was due to an order by Justice Ibrahim Buba of a Federal High Court in Lagos restraining the party from going ahead with its zonal congress. Justice Buba had on Thursday refrained the party from conducting zonal congress due to an ex parte application brought before him by the incumbent PDP South-West Zonal Secretary, Chief ‘Pegba Otemolu, Oladipo said. Oladipo stressed that in view of the court order, the party is forced to cancel its zonal congresses billed to hold in Ondo and Ijebu Igbo, Ogun State. He said, “We are a law-abiding party. I have been served the court order and as a respondent in the case, I’m telling you that we are not going to flout the order of the court. “I’m also aware that the Independent National Electoral Commission will also not be at the congress. “As a matter of fact, we are withdrawing our officers who have been sent to conduct the congress. We will stay action on it until the case if determined by the court.”
