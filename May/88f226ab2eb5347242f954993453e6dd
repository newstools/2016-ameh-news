 The Lagos State Government on Monday donated 50 new high-capacity bus rapid transit (BRT) vehicles to Primero Transport Services Limited to cushion the effect of the new pump price of premium motor spirit (PMS) on its residents. The firm’s Managing Director, Mr. Fola Tinubu, disclosed this at a news conference he addressed at its head office in Ikorodu, alongside other top officials, ruling out the likelihood of increasing fares due to rising inflation rate. Tinubu said the state government under the administration of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode had donated 50 new BRT buses to Primero Transport Services Limited at the instance of prevailing economic challenges in the country. He added that the decision of the state government would substantially reduce the effect of hike in fuel price on Lagos residents, hoping that more people in Ikorodu and its environs would patronise BRT. The managing director explained that with what the Ambode administration had done, more commuters “will leave their cars at home and use BRT,” which he said, would go a long way in reducing traffic congestions to the road users and waiting time at various terminals. He explained that the multiplier effect of this kind of intervention provided by the present administration “will lead to creation of more job opportunities for drivers, fleet officers, inspectors, mechanics, ticketers for smooth running and operations of the business.” However, the managing director ruled out the likelihood of increasing fares along the Ikorodu-CMS corridor, noting that there was no reason to increase fares with what the buses the governor had donated.
