No fewer than five persons lost their lives as a warehouse in Area A of the Nigerian Ports Authority in Port Harcourt collapsed. The sad incident, which happened during the weekend, caused confusion within the NPA in Rivers State. It was learnt that the ill-fated warehouse was an old facility used in storing sodium chloride. Punch reports that five persons were trapped in the rubble after a search was conducted a few minutes after the incident. “It happened on Saturday around 5pm and five persons, who were trapped in the rubble, were found dead,” the source said. An eyewitness said the walls fell and affected the bathroom and toilet close to the warehouse. “Those that died were around the bathroom and toilet area and the walls that fell affected them. Their bodies were found when the people began to open up blocks and search the rubble,” the source added.
