The Deputy Chairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Jonathan Gaza, on Thursday, said the corrected version of the 2016 budget has been transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration. Disclosing this to journalists yesterday at the National Assembly complex, Gaza said the budget has been resent to the Presidency through the Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, Senate, Senator Ita Enang. He said, “It is the same media that has kept the whole country abreast. Don’t forget that we are equally Nigerians and it is our desire for the country to move forward. A committee was set up, which was in the papers and was headed by the deputy speaker. Members from the Senate as well as the executive arm looked at the budget and I believe the resolutions have been transmitted or rather the resolutions have been submitted to the President. “I am quite optimistic and I enjoin all other Nigerians, including yourselves, to be as optimistic as me that in the very near future, this budget will be signed into law.” Gaza while commenting on when the budget was submitted and whether it was an amendment that was submitted said, “Well, I honestly believe that we have to be quite careful with our choice of words. “Over time, there have been differences and both arms of government had sat down to look at what those issues are. Most importantly, what we want is to see our country and our economy moving forward.” Recall that the current budget has been immersed in series of controversies following the refusal of President Muhammadu Buhari to sign it. Citing the exemption of some key projects from the budget document, Buhari had severally returned the document to the National Assembly for re-evaluation.
