Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Abdul Razak, has confirmed the crash of an helicopter in the eastern part of the country. The helicopter crashed on Friday but the fate of the six people on board, including a Deputy Minister, was unknown, a report stated. A search-and-rescue team found debris believed to be from the missing Eurocopter AS350 on Friday morning near the Batang Lupar River, the Prime Minister said. He said that the debris included a rotor blade, a floatation device, part of the helicopter body, a door and a seat. The helicopter was reported to have disappeared from radar just 20 minutes after it left Betong for Kuching at 4.12 p.m. on Thursday. The journey was supposed to take between 35 and 40 minutes. Betong is located south-east of Kuching. Sarawak is holding an election on Saturday for the state legislature, and has seen an influx of dozens of heavyweight politicians. The Plantation Industries and Commodities Deputy Minister, Noriah Kasnon, her husband and the ministry’s Secretary-General were on board the ill-fated chopper after going to Betong for an official event. The weather was bad at the time of the trip in Sarawak, where flying is the best mode of transport given the lack of roads through the state’s thick forests. The military were deployed to assist the police and fire and rescue department in the search.
