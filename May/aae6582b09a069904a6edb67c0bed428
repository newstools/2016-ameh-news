The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has beamed its searchlight on four former ministers, over their alleged involvement in the disbursement of about N23bn for the 2015 PDP presidential election campaign. The money was allegedly laundered by former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke. They are former Foreign Affairs Minister from Kano Alhaji Aminu Bashir Wali, former minister of state for foreign affairs from Jigawa, Dr. Nuruddeen Muhammad and a former minister from Katsina State. A former Deputy Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Mukhtar Shagari, was also expected to be arrested yesterday over the same allegation. While Wali was accused of collecting over N100m from the arms deal funds, Shagari allegedly collected over N200m. “The former foreign affairs minister was brought to EFCC Kano Zonal office, along Hajj Camp road. “Our men were also expected to bring in Shagari today (yesterday),” a source told Daily Trust. EFCC is seeking to unravel how Diezani, through Fidelity Bank Plc, disbursed N5billion to representatives of seven states in the North-west of the country. N1.3bn was reportedly received by two beneficiaries from Kano State, out of which N950m was received by Ambassador Aminu Bashir Wali. N406.2m was received on behalf of the late Kano State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Alhaji Mukaila Abdullahi, by one Sani Isa who is a retiree of the INEC in the state. The EFCC source said they all, according to investigations, collected money from Fidelity Bank after due certification of various means of identification as requested by the bank. It said Dr Nurudeen Muhammad received N500m out of the N750m disbursed to Jigawa State.
