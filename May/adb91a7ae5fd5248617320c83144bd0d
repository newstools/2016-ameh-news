The member representing Uhunmwode constituency in the Edo State House of Assembly, Mrs. Elizabeth Ativie,  has been sworn in as the new Speaker of the House. The House also lifted the suspension of the former Speaker, Mr. Victor Edoror, who was impeached last Tuesday. It, however, terminated the appointment of political appointees under the former Speaker. Ativie was sworn in on Monday by the Clerk of the House, Mr. Lawson Ugiagbe, in the presence of other members of the sixth Assembly, including Edoror. She becomes the first female Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly. ‎Prior to the resumption of sitting, the premises of the assembly complex was cordoned off by combined team of security operatives from the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Security and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps to forestall a possible break down of law and order. No fewer than 10 Hilux patrol vehicles and an armoured personnel carrier were strategically positioned around the complex. Policemen were also at the major entrance of the House of Assembly complex to monitor entry and exit. Edoror, representing ‎Esan Central (APC), was impeached and suspended last week, following an impeachment notice signed by 17 out of 24 lawmakers for alleged gross misconduct. His removal resulted in pandemonium with shootings, as suspected thugs from rivals groups invaded ‎the assembly complex. The thugs were later dispersed with tear gas canisters by a combined team of security operatives. Shortly after her swearing in on Monday, the new Speaker appreciated the lawmakers for expressing confidence in her leadership. She promised to lead the six Assembly with transparency, adding that the House would work tirelessly with other arms of government to ensure that the state reaches an enviable height.
