 Frontline Niger Delta activist, Chief Ayiri Emami has replied his kinsman and former militant leader, Government Ekpeumupolo, otherwise known as Tompolo over his recent accusations against him. Emami was responding to the tirade against him by Tompolo, who accused him of fabricating lies. In his reaction, Emami told Vanguard that, “Whatever I am saying is the truth, it is the right thing I am saying.” “If I am lying, why did the Delta state government set up an Advocacy Committee to stop pipeline vandalization in the creeks of the state? Who is the committee headed by the deputy governor going to meet in the creeks, is it Itsekiri militants or Ijaw militants. “I said it before that we all know those bombing the installations, they are going to meet them. If he says he is not the one, then, he should challenge in me, he can go to court. “I have my business that I am doing before I was dragged into the pipeline surveillance contract he was talking about under the late President Umaru Yar’Adua government. They did not bring me because I was the one bursting the pipelines, I was brought in because of my pedigree,” he said. Ayiri asserted: “There is nothing Tompolo will say that will make me backpedal in my support for the President Muhammadu Buhari government, he should come out from hiding and face the charges against him.”
