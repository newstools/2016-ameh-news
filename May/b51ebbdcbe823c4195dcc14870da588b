The Nigerian Communications Commission on Friday said it had decided to open up the 38 and 42-Gigahertz bands, as well as re-plan the 23GHz microwave spectrum band, to facilitate broadband penetration and improve the quality of telecommunications services in the country. It said that the decision was also consistent with its eight-point agenda to facilitate strategic collaboration and partnership with relevant stakeholders, optimise usage and benefit of spectrum, promote fair competition and ensure operational efficiency. According to the commission’s Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, the emerging trend in the telecoms market in Nigeria today is broadband. He, therefore, said, “If we are to achieve government’s broadband target of 30 per cent penetration by 2018, then this requires massive deployment of critical infrastructure like the 38 and 42GHz bands.” The NCC boss added, “At present, radio spectrum in the 38GHz, 42GHz bands are yet to be opened in Nigeria, and the channeling plan for the 23GHz needs to be reviewed in line with international best practice to meet requirement of higher output.” Danbatta stated that the commission recognised that it was important to review the channeling plan in some of the existing microwave frequency bands, as well as open and license other frequency bands that were commercially viable. “This will enable efficient use of the spectrum. In addition, this will enable the operators to effectively meet their spectrum needs for roll out of broadband services,” he said.
