 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has denied forcing Robert Azibaola to indict former President Goodluck Jonathan.
The anti-graft agency therefore asked Justice Mojisola Olatoregun-Ishola of a Federal High Court in Lagos to dismiss a suit filed against Azibaola, who is said to be a cousin to Jonathan. It maintained that Azibaola’s detention was for the purpose of investigating an alleged fraud of $40m against him.
It urged the court to dismiss the suit in the interest of justice, claiming that letting Azibaola go would undermine its ongoing investigations. While urging the court to refuse Azibaola’s prayers, Hassan claimed that he filed the suit to frustrate investigations against him so that he could evade prosecution. “An application for the enforcement of fundamental rights does not serve as a defence or shield from criminal investigation,” Hassan said, adding that the EFCC had perfected plans to charge Azibaola to court based on its findings. “This suit is frivolous, time-wasting, an abuse of court processes and should be dismissed with cost,” Hassan said.
In the suit filed through his lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, Azibaola alleged that the EFCC had been detaining him unlawfully since March 23 when he voluntarily honoured an invitation by the anti-graft agency.
