The Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta, General Paul Boroh (rtd) on Friday disclosed that the Federal Government is open to discussions with Niger Delta Militants over their grievances. Boroh, who is also the Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, made this disclosure in Abuja while speaking with reporters. According to him, “Pipeline vandalism is an avoidable self-inflicted agony. It is unreasonable to engage in such criminal activity not only because of the resultant economic effect on the country but particularly as it also negatively affects the Niger Delta environment. The act of vandalising pipelines is counter-productive apart from it being a crime against the state. Those involved in this nefarious activity are economic and environmental saboteurs. It will do well for them to refrain from it, as my office is always open to dialogue regardless of their grievances. “The federal government already has in place a well-structured reintegration programme for youths of the region, which has helped in maintaining the peace and stabilising security of the region. “The Amnesty Programme has made militancy unattractive in the region mainly because of the government’s sincerity and commitment to the programme. The proper thing is for those behind such activity to embrace dialogue.” Boroh spoke on the heels of the recent attack on Chevron Valve Platform in Warri South-West Local government Area of Delta state by suspected Niger Delta militants.
