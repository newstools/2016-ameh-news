 The Rivers State government says it will adhere strictly to the ‘no work, no pay’ directive of the Federal government on any civil servant that complies with the industrial action called by the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC.
The state Head of Service, Rufus Godwin disclosed this while addressing newsmen in Port Harcourt. Civil servants in Rivers State had met a locked gate at the State secretariat on arrival to work on the first day of the nationwide strike.
It took the effort of security operatives supervised by the Head of Service to open the gates for workers to gain access into the premises. However, Godwin said the state government was bound by the subsisting order of the National Industrial court. He said the civil servants working under the Rivers state government were not allowed to participate in the industrial action. “We are going to apply the Federal government directive of no work, no pay rule. We will be strict on that. Anybody who absents himself from work will be treated accordingly under the relevant rules,” he said.
