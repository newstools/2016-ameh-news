Suspected herdsmen have reportedly killed 12 people, including seven men, two women and children in Coromo, Dan- Anacha and Mutum Biyu communities in Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State. Eighteen persons were also injured while 13 houses were burnt down in the melee. The affected communities were dominated by Tiv speaking people of Benue. The Fulani herdsmen reportedly launched the attack during the weekend following a long standing land dispute. It was gathered that they stormed the three communities in the night and started attacking Tivs who had come back to farm on their lands. The Tiv people have since fled the area for fear of further attacks, despite the presence of armed security men.
