 President Muhammadu Buhari has explained why the Nigerian military is yet to defeat the Boko Haram sect. He attributed the development to corruption. According to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President spoke while granting audience to the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Dr. Ahmed El-Tayeb, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Buhari said the loss of 14 local government areas to Boko Haram had greatly tarnished the reputation of the Nigerian Armed Forces. The President noted, however, that with measures taken by his administration to curb corruption and provide better weaponry, logistics, training and welfare for soldiers on the frontlines, the Nigerian military had now almost totally incapacitated Boko Haram as a fighting force and recovered all territories that were lost to the terrorist sect. “When we curbed corruption and removed the injustice in the military, we began to make progress,” President Buhari said. The President said that the war against terrorism was also a war against injustice, which was not condoned by Islam and all the major religions. “You can’t kill the innocent in churches or in mosques and shout Allahu Akbar,” the President said.
