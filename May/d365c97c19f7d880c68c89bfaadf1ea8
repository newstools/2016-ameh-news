The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC), is spending US$100 million on the prevention of corruption, drugs and terrorism in Nigeria, says its Secretary-General, Yury Fedotov, who is on a two-day official visit to the country. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) here Wednesday that Nigeria is one of the largest recipient of international support from the UNODC. “I think our portfolio programmes for the following amount to 100 million USD. So it makes Nigeria one of the largest recipients of assistance of the international community through the UNODC,” he said. Fedotov commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his stance on corruption, and pledged the UNODC’s support for its success. “I think the commitment of President Buhari to eradicate corruption is a very important asset for us in UNODC as the guardian of the UN Convention Against Corruption. In particular, we are prepared to discuss how to inter-act with Nigeria in the implementation of the second cycle of the Convention,” he said. “The Convention has very important aspect; first of all for the prevention of corruption and secondly, the anti-money laundering and the return of stolen assets.” Anti-corruption is a very important and topical issue, which Nigeria can count on the organization for its support. Fedotov also said the UNODC was supporting Nigeria in the area of de-radicalisation to prevent its prisons from becoming “academies” for criminals and terrorists. “In Nigeria, we have a joint programme with the UNDP on de-redicalisation. I am also looking forward to visiting the prison in Abuja,” he added.
