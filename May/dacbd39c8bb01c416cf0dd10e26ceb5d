Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, has said he will not contest the 2019 presidential election. Okorocha, who is the chairman of All Progressives Congress, APC, Governors’ Forum, also gave what seemed like an endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari, for re-election in 2019. Speaking with newsmen at the weekend during a tour of projects, Okorocha said: “I have been running for the presidency until God said I should settle for the Imo governorship. That passion to become the President of the country is not just borne out of the thirst for the position, but had arisen out of the eagerness to offer the nation and her people a strong leadership; the essence would be to build a nation of our collective dreams and aspirations. “President Buhari came in and, within one year, Nigeria has once again got the doors of the rest of the world opened for her. “He has shown courage, confidence, maturity and strong leadership. There is now high feelings of leadership in the country. What he, therefore, needs is to be supported and encouraged.”
