 The presidency has promised to take care of the rescued Chibok girl, Amina Ali.
President Muhammadu Buhari made this pledge when he received the girl, who was rescued in Borno State on Wednesday by members of the Civilian Joint Task Force, at the Presidential Villa. Buhari said like all Nigerians and many others all over the world, he was happy that the young lady was back alive.
He, however, said his feelings were tinged with deep sadness because of the horrors the girl had to go through at such an early stage in her life. He said that nobody in Nigeria should be put through the brutality of forced marriage, adding that every girl has a right to education and their choice of life. He said, “Amina will get the best care that the Nigerian government can afford. We will ensure that she gets the best medical, emotional and whatever care that she requires to get full recovery and be integrated into the society‎. “Yesterday (Wednesday), medical personnel from government and other NGOs examined her for a total of about five hours. Trauma experts from UNICEF also met her.
“The Federal Government will assist the Murtala Mohammed Foundation which has already been providing support for the families of the missing Chibok girls and which runs a truama and counseling faciity in Kano, will also be involved in the ongoing work with Amina in monitoring her progress and any additional support she requires. “The continuation of Amina’s education so abruptly disrupted will definitely be a propriety of the Federal Government. “Amina must be able go back to school. Nobody in Nigeria should be put through the brutality of forced marriage, every girl has a right to education and their choice of life.”
