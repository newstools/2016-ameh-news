 Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has dismissed allegations that he was behind the resurgence of militant attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta. Responding to questions during an interview, the Rivers State Governor blamed the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress for spreading the allegation. Governor Wike said the matter regarding resurgence of militants’ activities in the Niger Delta featured in the discussions of PDP state governors from the South-South in Asaba Delta State. According to Wike, “There are things you sell to people and they will buy. How will any Governor in the South-South today sponsor the blowing up of pipelines and flow stations. If we do that, we won’t get the revenue. Already you can see the drop in the FAAC. “We the Governors of the South-South have met with the President. I will not let the cat out of the bag but I can tell you that what we have done is for the interest of Nigerians.” He recalled that he was at the Presidential Villa in Abuja yesterday during which he held a brief closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.
