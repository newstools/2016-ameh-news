 Governor of Bayelsa state, Seriake Dickson, has decried the rate of kidnapping in recent times in the state, even as he restated the government’s position on the payment of ransom, noting that negotiating with kidnappers would also be a crime in the state.
The governor condemned the killing of security operatives in the state, vowing that nobody will be allowed to get away with violence and bloodshed henceforth. He gave the warning during his series of meetings with heads of security agencies, traditional rulers, community leaders and youth groups over the spate of killing of security operatives in the state.
The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Dan­iel Iworiso-Markson recalled the military’s invasion of Odi in Kolokuma/Opo­kuma and Odioma in Brass Local Government Areas, adding that the incidents should serve as a lesson to other communities. The governor, while stressing the need to curb the spate of criminal activities such as kidnapping, pipeline vandalism and the attack on law enforcement agents in the state, urged the people to work closely with security agencies towards apprehending the perpetrators. Dickson decried the activities of oil pipeline vandals, which he noted, was adversely affecting the revenue of the state, coupled with the degradation of the environment and called on those engaged in the act to desist. He expressed government’s determination to stem the tide of violence, criminality and brigandage in and outside the state as he called on community leaders to collaborate with security agencies to maintain law and order in their domains to avert a recurrence.
He said, “Nobody within and outside the state would be allowed to create havoc and make Bayelsa to be a place for violence and bloodshed.” He stressed that security was a collective responsibility for all.
