 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested former Kaduna State Commissioner of Finance, Alhaji Ramalan Yaro and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Kano state, Alhaji Salihu Sagir Takai. The anti-graft agency nabbed the duo on Monday in connection with the N23bn campaign fund shared by former Minister of Petroluem, Deizani Alison-Madueke. They were interrogated all through the night at the EFCC zonal office in Kano. The secretary of PDP in Kano, Alhaji Auwalu Ibrahim Danzabuwa was also arrested. PDP chieftain in Kano, Alhaji Musa Iliyasu Kwankwaso, said they were trying to meet the bail conditions laid down by the anti-graft agency. Meanwhile, Kwankwaso has described the EFCC’s action as witch-hunt. He said: “If the commission is serious about the fight against corruption, it should extend its operation to some APC members because they too shared campaign money during last general elections. This campaign fund is a tradition in Nigerian politics and all political parties did the same thing in 2015 election. “On Monday, some operatives of the commission have stormed our party’s campaign office and conducted a search. They were accompanied by the party’s secretary Auwalu Ibrahim Danzabuwa to our office for the search. This is injustice being mated against PDP members.”
