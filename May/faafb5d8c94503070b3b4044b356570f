 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged Nigerians to disregard the call for strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) regarding the increase in price of fuel.
This is contained in a statement released to newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja by the South-South Chairman, Prince Hilliard Eta and the six states’ chairmen. According to the statement, the price modulation by the Federal Government was a timely intervention in the oil sector.
It said that as a result of the deregulation, market forces would soon crash the high price. “We call on all well-meaning compatriots to rally in support of deregulation. “We are convinced that given the opportunity, the deregulation policy will yield positive dividends in the short and long run. “Already, market forces are in action to crash the price of petrol as government is no longer directly involved in price fixing.
“The subsidy was intended as a palliative measure by government to cushion the effect of the relatively high cost of petrol and related products. “However, in a bizarre twist, most of the people involved in the importation, distribution and marketing of petroleum products blatantly indulge in underhand practices to create a never-ending artificial scarcity,which shot prices very high as recently experienced in the country,” it said.
