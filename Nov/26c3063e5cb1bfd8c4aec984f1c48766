The Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation, on Friday said the Federal Government will build 1,000 kilometres of pipeline from Agadam Niger Republic, to supply crude oil to Kaduna refinery. The GMD made the disclosure to newsmen during a visit to the Kaduna Refinery Petrochemical Company Limited in Kaduna. Baru said high level contacts have been made with Niger Republic on the possibility of importing crude from the country. He said, “President Muhammadu Buhari has made several contacts with the President of Niger Republic “We are talking with Niger Ministry of petroleum. We are also talking with the Chinese Company operating in Agadam .” Baru said some investors have shown interest to build another refinery of 50,000 barrels pay day capacity. He said, “We are convincing them to come and build side by side with the Kaduna refinery. “The intention is to build around Kano but we think there is greater synergy to what I have seen here. I am more convinced they will benefit from some of the utilities of Kaduna refinery.” NAN
