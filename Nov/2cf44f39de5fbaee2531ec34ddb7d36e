A Senior Counselor in the Sultanate Council of Sokoto, Alhaji Hassan Danbaba, on Tuesday describes the late 18th Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki, as a pious and committed leader. Danbaba, who is also the Magajin Garin Sokoto, was reacting to the death of Dasuki on Monday night at an Abuja hospital at the age of 93 after a protracted illness. According to Danbaba, “The late Dasuki was a peace lover and a peace maker in Nigeria and beyond. “He had worked meritoriously to ensure national development and cohesion. His death is a great loss not only to his family, Sokoto State, but Nigeria as a whole.” In his reaction, the former Governor of Sokoto State, Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC-Sokoto), described Dasuki as, ”a gentleman who lived a life of total service to humanity. “He was a man of God and a man of Peace,” Wamakko, who represents Sokoto Central Senatorial District, added. Another Senior Counselor in the Sultanate and Galadiman Gari, Alhaji Aliyu Attahiru, said the death of Dasuki was a great loss to his family, the Muslim Ummah and the entire nation. The Secretary of the Sultanate, Alhaji Umar Faruk, who confirmed the death of the former Sultan in a statement, said that, the remains of Dasuki would be buried in Sokoto after the afternoon prayer (Zuhr) on Tuesday. Late Dasuki was deposed as Sultan in 1996 during the military regime of late Gen. Sani Abacha. Prior to becoming Sultan, he held the traditional title of Baraden Sokoto and was the first Sultan from the Buhari lineage of the descendants of Sheik Usmanu Dan Fodio. Dasuki, who was born on Dec. 31, 1923, was a close associate of the late Premier of Northern Nigeria, Sir Ahmadu Bello and a friend of the Late Islamic scholar, Malam Abubakar Gumi. The late Sultan was influential in the founding of Jama’atul Nasril Islam. NAN
