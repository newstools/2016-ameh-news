The Anambra State Government, in conjunction with the Presidential Technical Committee on Land Reform, has finalised arrangements to start a systematic land titling and registration in the state. According to the state government, this will make the process of land registration and the acquisition of Certificates of Occupancy easy. It added in a statement that the PTCLR and the state government had agreed to work together to adopt the new land titling and registration process as against the old sporadic system that was cumbersome, less transparent, slow and expensive. The Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Nkem Okeke, who is the chairman of the committee, was quoted to have said that the programme would transform the lives of residents of the state. Okeke added that it would create opportunities for empowerment through the acquisition of land titles as collateral for loans. The Chairman, PTCLR, Prof. Peter Adeniyi, was also quoted to have said that proper land titling and registration would help the government to know its land resources and taxable property. “Systematic land titling and registration is a process by which rights to land in a particular area are ascertained and documented in an official register of land titles. It is a process initiated by the government for the purpose of knowing who owns what and where, and subsequently issuing a title in respect of the land,” he said. Adeniyi added that there was a need for the Federal Government to overhaul the present land governance system in the country with a view to achieving increased internally generated revenue, tenure security, employment and poverty reduction. He stated that the government had not been able to properly plan and manage land due to the absence of data, and had also failed to generate reasonable revenue from its land resources in terms of taxes and transaction fees.
