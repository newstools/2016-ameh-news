The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Sunday said it would complete the Ajaokuta-Abuja-Kaduna-Kano gas pipeline in order to drive energy supply projects needed to power industries in the northern part of the country, particularly those in Kaduna. The corporation also stated that it would upgrade and expand the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited, in line with its 12 key business focus areas, so as to return the facility to the path of growth and profitability. The Group Managing Director, NNPC, Dr. Maikanti Baru, disclosed these during a town hall meeting with the management and staff of the KRPC in Kaduna, according to a statement issued by the corporation on Sunday. The incessant vandalism of oil installations in the Niger Delta seems to have made the NNPC to increase its crude oil exploration and energy development drive in the northern part of the country in the last couple of months. About two weeks ago, the national oil firm confirmed that it was intensifying its search for crude oil in the North-East geopolitical zone, and earlier announced that it had received a directive from President Muhammadu Buhari to explore for crude in the Lake Chad Basin and the Benue Trough.
