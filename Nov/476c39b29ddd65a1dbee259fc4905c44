 The House of Representatives on Wednesday ordered an investigation into alleged “multiple statutory violations” by the Bureau of Public Enterprises. Lawmakers took the decision in Abuja, following complaints by the Fiscal Responsibility Commission that the BPE was in frequent breach of the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. For instance, the commission reported that the BPE failed to provide the audited accounts of the agency for the financial years 2012-2015. It also allegedly failed to remit its operating surplus for 2007, totalling N81.8million. The House at its Wednesday plenary presided over by the Speaker, Mr. Yakubu Dogara, mandated the Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation to investigate the breaches within four weeks. The resolution was passed after a motion sponsored by a member, Mr. Abbas Tajudeen, on the issue, was endorsed by the House. In his lead debate, Tajudeen drew the attention of the House to how the BPE also reportedly violated Section 22(1)(2) of the Public Enterprises (Privatisation and Commercialisation) Act, 1999. “The law compels the Bureau to keep proper accounts and cause them to be audited by auditors appointed from the list and in accordance with the guidelines supplied by the Auditor-General of the Federation “, he stated.
