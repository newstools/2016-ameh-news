Lafarge Africa Plc says it has launched its debut sustainability report in line with the latest standard of the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4. The company unveiled the 2015 Sustainability Report at the grand finale of the third edition of the Lafarge Africa National Literacy Competition in Lagos. According to him, Lafarge’s sustainability development strategy, also known as the 2030 Plan, remains the company’s internal roadmap on how it intends to play its own part in addressing the planet’s biggest issues as the company has the opportunity and responsibility to make a positive difference. He said, “The Sustainability Report is, therefore, part of our methodology of increasing our level of transparency in sharing our sustainable development performance with our stakeholders. “It is a voluntary disclosure beyond listing requirements. The report reiterates Lafarge’s commitment to promoting best practices and engaging with the company’s internal and external stakeholders.” The Managing Director, Lafarge Africa, Mr. Michel Puchercos, said the company was driven by the ambition to set new standards and help transform the way the industry works. He added that the report would help the company to review, prioritise and take key decisions for improving its sustainability efforts.
