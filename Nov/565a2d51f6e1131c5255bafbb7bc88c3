Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State says daily consumption of foodstuffs in the state is worth over N3bn. The governor spoke at the maiden edition of the Lagos Food Security and Exhibition Summit with the theme, ‘Actualising Sustainable Food Security in Lagos State: A New Comprehensive Agenda,’ adding that his administration would maximise Lagos comparative advantage to achieve food security. He said, “Nigeria has no business importing foodstuffs to feed its citizens. We must cultivate the land and improve efficiency in the agricultural value chain. “Our core policy thrust towards achieving food security is to maximise the comparative advantage of the state in agriculture and partner other states.” Ambode said his administration had partnered the Kebbi State Government for the development of agricultural commodities such as rice, wheat, groundnut and onion, expressing optimism that the partnership would result in the supply of 70 per cent of the total national rice consumption. “We have also acquired agricultural land in Ogun, Osun and Oyo states, as well as Abuja for rice cultivation and oil palm processing, among others,” the governor said. He said the summit was organised to bring together stakeholders in the agricultural sector to proffer solutions to the challenges militating against the achievement of food security. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Food Security, Mr. Sanni Okanlawon, said the summit would realign emerging realities with new global trends on food safety, processing and funding for agr0business. The Chairman of the summit, Alhaji Sani Dangote, said despite the shortage of arable land, the state should leverage on its comparative advantages to feed itself and neighbouring states.
