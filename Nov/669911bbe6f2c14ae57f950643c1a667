President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday extended his condolences to the family of Ajayi and the  Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on the death of one of its oldest surviving members, Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, at 91. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, the President also commiserated with the government and people of Ogun State on the death of their
“illustrious son, author, legal practitioner, elder statesman and nationalist.” Buhari recalled Ajayi’s inspirational and dedicated work to entrench and strengthen democracy in Nigeria through his passionate engagements in Afenifere, the National Democratic Coalition and the Patriots. The statement read, “Guided by Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s principle, the President believes that the late revered Yoruba leader effectively combined his sharp commentary on the state of affairs in Nigeria with uncommon patriotism while working tenaciously to further unity, development and prosperity in the nation. “President Buhari urges all who mourn Pa Ajayi to emulate his lifelong commitment to dialogue, democracy and development, which are key ingredients for national growth.
“He prays that God will comfort Pa Ajayi’s family and grant the soul of the departed eternal rest.”
