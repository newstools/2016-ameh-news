To further boost its ongoing metering initiative, the Eko Electricity Distribution Company has entered into agreement with Huawe to facilitate the installation of prepaid meters within its network. Eko DISCO under its metering plan is expected to deploy 600,000 meters to its customers.
To mark the end of the MoU deal with the Chinese technology company the agreement with Huawei, is that customers within Eko DISCO network will be fully metered.
Chairman of West Power Gas, Owners of Eko DISCO, Mr. Charles Momoh speaking at the signing of the agreement at the just concluded West Africa Power Industry Convention, WAPIC 2016 in Lagos, said the deal will speed up the company’s meter installation program before the deadline of Bureau of Public Enterprise, BPE five years metering scheme with distribution companies.
Also, Eko DISCO Managing Director, Engr. Oladele Amoda in his comment, said, besides the Huawei deal, the company also has an agreement with Nigeria’s meter manufacturer, MOJEC and MOMANS to meter their customers.
“You know that we have another agreement with MOJEC and MOMANS. So we want to accelerate our metering process to ensure that we meet our five year agreement with BPE to meter our customers within the period. We signed a five years meeting program with BPE so we are accelerating our activities in order to meet the deadline,” he said.
Commenting on the duration of the metering installation program, Engr, Amoda said: “All things been equal, we hope to complete the installation of prepaid meters to all our customers in the next two years and meet BPE deadline.
Although there are lots of factors affecting us such as the exchange rate, inflation etc. but from the way we have planned it, if everything goes well we are looking between two to three years, at least within BPE performance agreement period.”
