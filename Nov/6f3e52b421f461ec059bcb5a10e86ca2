President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented that some Nigerians who had corruptly enriched themselves in the past are currently using the stolen funds to wage war against his administration. He said the situation has made his administration’s ongoing anti-corruption war “tough and grueling.” According to a statement on Thursday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, the President spoke on Thursday in a meeting he had with the United States Secretary of State, John Kerry,  on the margins of conference on climate change, COP22, in Marrakech, Morocco, Although he said corruption was fighting vigorously back, the President assured Kerry that the anti-graft war would be won. Buhari said corrupt people had accumulated a formidable arsenal of illicit wealth, which they were now deploying against the government on diverse fronts. “But it is a war we are determined to win, and which we will win. People of goodwill are behind us, countries like America and many others are with us, and we will surely win,” he said.
