President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday commiserated with the government and people of Lagos State on the death of a former Minister of National Planning, Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, the President also extended condolences to all family members, friends and professional colleagues of the late acclaimed economist, eminent industrialist, playwright and promoter of arts and culture. He urged them to be consoled by the fact that Gbadamosi’s contributions in these diverse fields of life would be appreciated for a long time. Buhari also said the nation would remain ever grateful for the meritorious and exemplary roles Gbadamosi played not only as a minister, but also  as a former chairman of the Bank of Industry and the Petroleum Products Pricing and Regulatory Agency. “There is no doubting the fact that the economic development of Nigeria was always uppermost in his mind,” the President reminisced about the ex-development expert. Buhari prayed that the almighty God will grant the soul of the deceased eternal rest, and comfort his family.
