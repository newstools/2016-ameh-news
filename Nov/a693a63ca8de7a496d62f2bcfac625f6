Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), connived with the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to rig the Ondo Governorship election. INEC, on Sunday, announced APC candidate, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), as the winner of the polls conducted on Saturday, November 26, 2016 But Fayose said there was more to the victory that meets the eye. He said: “Just as I would have loved to congratulate the winner, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), because in every contest, there must be a winner and a loser, the role of INEC in awarding victory to him in the election left much to be desired.” In a statement released by his Special Assistant on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, Fayose also alleged that INEC deliberately replaced the name of PDP candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, thereby causing confusion that lasted till three days to the election. He also claimed that all political parties apart from APC, were now contesting elections against INEC. Fayose said: “to sustain the ‘see and buy’ strategy and legalise money politics, the APC-led federal government deliberately created poverty in the country so as to continue to enslave the minds of Nigerians with peanuts to get their votes on election day, saying; “Dibo ko sebe (vote and collect money to cook soup) was the slang used by the APC in the Ondo State election and that only worked because the APC federal government have put Nigerians in abject poverty. “Even though INEC allowed what appeared like a free and fair atmosphere on the election day, the election had been won and lost before it was held. “For instance, INEC that witnessed the PDP primary election that produced Mr Eyitayo Jegede succumbed to pressure from the APC cabal to replace him with Jimoh Ibrahim, who did not take part in any primary election known to the Electoral Act. “What could anyone have done under 72 hours in an election that was heavily monetised by the APC?
