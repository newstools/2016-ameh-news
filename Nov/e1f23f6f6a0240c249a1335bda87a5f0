Republican billionaire Donald Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday he would forgo the $400,000 salary that comes with the US president’s job. “I’m not going to take the salary. I’m not taking it,” he told CBS’s “60 minutes,” confirming a promise he made in a campaign video in September. “I think I have to by law take $1, so I’ll take $1 a year,” he added.
