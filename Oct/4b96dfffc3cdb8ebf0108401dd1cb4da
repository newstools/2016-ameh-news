The Washington Post on Thursday became the latest US newspaper to emphatically endorse Hillary Clinton for the White House, saying it was swayed as much by her competence as by the alarming specter of a Donald Trump presidency. “Hillary Clinton has the potential to be an excellent president of the United States, and we endorse her without hesitation,” the influential US daily wrote, adding, “no, we are not making this endorsement simply because Ms Clinton’s chief opponent is dreadful.” Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee “is dogged, resilient, purposeful and smart,” the newspaper wrote while acknowledging her many political and personal missteps of the past — failings it said are outweighed by her strengths. “She has executive experience. She does not let her feelings get in the way of the job at hand. She is well positioned to get something done,” the daily wrote. The newspaper took note of the former first lady’s litany of shortcomings, writing: “We recognize that many Americans distrust and dislike Ms Clinton. The negative feelings reflect in part the bitter partisanship of the nation’s politics today; in part the dishonest attacks she has been subjected to for decades; and in part her genuine flaws, missteps and weaknesses. “We are not blind to those,” wrote The Post, which nevertheless gave Clinton its full-throated support. The Post editorial made little mention of Trump, the bombastic real estate magnate who is the Republican nominee for next month’s presidential election. Trump has been eviscerated by the editorial board of The Post and many other leading US newspapers in numerous other opinion pieces over the past several weeks, as the raucous US election heads for the final few weeks.
