Representatives of 42 investors from European countries will come into the country next month to consider areas of investment in the various sectors of the Nigerian economy, the Federal Government has said. According to the government, the advance teams of the investors will be in Nigeria in November to meet with stakeholders in the different sectors that they wish to invest in, while the full delegation will be in the country by February 2017. The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, who said this during a press briefing on Monday in Abuja, stated that the investors would invest in power, agriculture, construction and many other sectors. Ogbeh also stated that the Federal Government had commenced moves to woo youths into agriculture as it had located hectares of lands in various states where it would establish large farmlands for the cultivation of agricultural produce. On those coming to Nigeria, Ogbeh said, “The investors are coming from different areas of investment. A good number of them are coming to invest in agriculture and food processing, some in power supply, solar energy especially. We talked to some people in Italy about ceramic tiles and building materials production. “So many of them, after seeing the presentations made by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment during our trip to Germany, said they were definitely going to rethink on what to do.”
