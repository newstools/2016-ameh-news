 The Senator representing Southern Kaduna senatorial district, Mr Danjuma La’ah has said that the Boko Haram terrorists and not Fulani herdsmen‎ were behind the persistent maiming, killing and destructions of lives and property in his constituency. The Senator, who disclosed this in an interview with DAILY POST in Kafanchan, Sunday said, “The situation is frustrating looking at the strategic way of carrying their activities on our communities. “Our Fulani herdsmen who we have grown to know each other for years cannot continue to be killing our people unabated despite dialogue and consultations to reconcile and continue our mutual co-existence as we were at the past. “So far, about 20 people have been killed; virtually every house in the community was raised down by fire by the attackers Saturday night and it continued this morning,”Senator La’ah frowned. He maintained that the security agencies were out of place, stressing: “They are only there to prove to us that they are doing their official work. This attack is long overdue to bear, people with their own ancestral land have become refugees.” According to him, “The killings can’t continue like this, we must rise up and stop it. I am trying to get in touch with all the security agencies to put our head together to know the next plan of action and ensure we curtail the occurrence of this deadly menace on our people,” La’ah lamented. He disclosed that more than ten communities so far had deserted their ancestral homes without any action by the government to provide succor to them. “It is unfortunate; despite the killings going on in Southern Kaduna, the Federal government has not said anything talk more of providing security personnel to help man the vulnerable communities”, he added. ‎
