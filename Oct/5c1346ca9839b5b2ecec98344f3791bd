The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, Ibrahim Magu, said on Tuesday that the EFCC was investigating some officers of the current administration under President Muhammadu Buhari. Magu said this had become possible because the governing All Progressives Congress, under Buhari, had the political will to fight corruption in the country. Also, Magu said the President had given an order to investigate any Nigerian, no matter how highly-placed. The EFCC chairman said this when he paid a courtesy visit to the National Union of Textiles and Garment Tailoring Workers of Nigeria in Kaduna. He said the operations of the anti-graft commission were not selective in their fight against graft as being insinuated in some quarters. Magus added, “We have cause to investigate, and in fact, we are investigating even those that are in government without them knowing. “The President has given me the mandate to investigate every Nigerian, irrespective of his political affiliation. “The fight against corruption is designed and structured to boost confidence in the economy as well as to attract investors both within and outside the country.” Earlier, the General Secretary of the Textiles Workers Union, Alhaji Issa Aremu, had said the fight against corruption should not be left to the EFCC and the ICPC alone.
