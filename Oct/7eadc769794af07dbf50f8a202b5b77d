 The death toll in the bomb blast that rocked Maiduguri on Wednesday has risen to eight, the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, said. A police statement, earlier, said five people were killed when a Volkswagen golf car loaded with passengers exploded outside a crowded car. An operative of the Civilian-JTF, Dan-Batta, had also told journalists that they picked only six bodies and four injured persons from the scene. “We have evacuated six dead bodies and four injured persons from the scene and the injured were already taken to the State Specialists Hospital here in Maiduguri,” he said. “We cannot say if it was suicide bombing car or it has persons carrying explosives as passengers,” said Mr. Dan-Batta. “But most of the persons that died may have been the passengers; though their bodies were thrown around the shattered vehicle.” But a statement by NEMA’s spokesperson, Sani Datti, said eight people were killed and 15 were injured.
The NEMA statement reads: “A total of 8 persons lost their lives and 15 injured in the explosion that occurred early this morning at Muna motor park, Maiduguri, Borno State. The rescue team of National Emergency Management Agency promptly responded to the incident and evacuated the injured persons and the bodies of the dead victims to University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and Borno State Specialist Hospital. “The explosion occurred outside the park, located in the outskirt of the town and is used by motorists that carry passengers to the Dikwa, Gamboru Ngala axis of the state. “The Injured persons taken to the hospitals are presently being attended. Security has been beefed up at the scene of the explosion, said Mr Dattia who is NEMA’s Media and Public Relations officer.”
