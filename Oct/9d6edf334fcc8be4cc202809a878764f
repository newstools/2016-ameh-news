The Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, has said he is committed to the success of the Badagry Deep Sea Port Project, which has attracted an estimated investment of $2.3bn (N724.5bn). Ambode also said his administration’s policies were geared towards creating a friendly environment to encourage private sector participation in driving economic development in the state, according to a statement on Friday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Habib Aruna. The governor stated this on Thursday when he met with the representatives of the Netherlands-based APM Terminals, an international container terminal operating company in London. Saying that the Badagry Deep Sea Port Project would address the infrastructural enhancement and urban renewal agenda of the state, Ambode commended the resolve of the investors to stay the course on the project, adding that the facility would generate over 500,000 direct and indirect jobs on completion. The governor also assured that the state would spare nothing to see to the fruition of the project, while pledging that the interests of the host communities within the location of the project would be protected. He also said the project, on completion, would be the biggest in the African continent as it is expected to sit on a land space of over 1,000 hectares. The Head of APM Terminals, Africa, Mr. Peter Volkjaer Jorgensen, said the company was “strongly” committed to partnering the Lagos State Government on the project.
