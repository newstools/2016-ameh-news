A leading professional services and auditing firm, Akintola Williams Deloitte, has emphasised the importance of technology in deepening financial services in Nigeria and Africa in general. The company’s Chief Executive Officer for Africa, Mr. Lwazi Bam, said the integration of its branches, through cutting-edge technology was meant to offer quality professional services to its clients He spoke at the official opening of the company’s new ultra-modern office in Lagos. According to him, the new resources brought into its corporate finance team are part of the company’s diversification strategy in order to build a strong advisory business. Bam said, “Years ago, we started this journey of integration; we embarked on a journey to integrate all our English-speaking firms across Africa. We said what was driving the integration was to achieve consistent line service across the continent. “A lot goes into achieving top quality consistent service but infrastructure or a building is a starting point for that. Opening this building is evidence of prioritisation, it is evidence of investing in Nigeria.” The Chief Executive Officer, Deloitte West Africa, Mr. Fatai Folarin, said the new office would make the firm easily accessible to its clients. “We are here to enable us transform the firm to the level to which we aspire. Our aspiration is to have a practice bigger than what we have today. In this building is a lot of investment that relates to how best we can serve our clients. “Today, when you talk in terms of audit methodology and cutting-edge technology, we are a second to none. We invest so much more in technology because of our services to our clients.” The event, which attracted retired partners of the firm, had in attendance the Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Jim Ovia; Prof. Pat Utomi, among others.
