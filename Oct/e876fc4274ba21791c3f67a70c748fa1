No fewer than 500 youths have been employed by the Sokoto State Government for refuse evacuation. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Alhaji Aminu Dodo-Iya, made the disclosure at the end of the monthly environmental sanitation in Sokoto on Saturday. Dodo-Iya said that the youths had since been redeployed and they had swung into action. He said, “These youths will continuously operate to rid the city and its environs of filth. They will be used for daily clearance and evacuation of refuse in the city.” Dodo-Iya also said that the state government had purchased 30 specialised refuse evacuation tricycles. He explained that the tricycles were being deployed in hard-to-reach areas of the city. The permanent secretary decried the nonchalant attitude of the residents toward the exercise, adding that the state government might be forced to wield the big stick, using the tribunals. He said, “This is to force the residents to ensure personal and environmental hygiene to keep diseases at bay.” Also, the Director-General of the Sokoto Central Market, Alhaji Abdullahi Bafarawa, said that the management of the market had fully mobilised its personnel to actively participate in the exercise. Bafarawa said that the gesture was to clear the market and its environs of the heaps of refuse.
