The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, on Thursday denied involvement in any illegal transfer of funds out of Nigeria by MTN. The minister said in a statement signed by the Director of Press, Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Greyne Anosike, that he was never the owner or a shareholder of Celtelecom as alleged by Senator Dino Melaye. Melaye had in a motion on the floor of the Senate alleged that MTN illegally transferred $13.9bn out of Nigeria with the help of the minister. The motion was made to launch an investigation into the alleged illegal transfer of funds. But the minister said in the statement, “Our attention has been drawn to a statement credited to a serving Nigerian senator on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, September 27, 2016, making a number of allegations against the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah regarding improper remittance of funds out of Nigeria.”
