Outgoing President Barack Obama condemned Donald Trump as unsuitable to be commander-in-chief Thursday, after the Republican nominee blasted US military brass and praised Vladimir Putin.  “I don’t think the guy’s qualified to be president of the United States and every time he speaks, that opinion is confirmed,” Obama said in unusually caustic language while overseas. Obama is in Laos for a summit with South East Asia leaders and his final trip to east Asia. “I can tell you from the interactions I have had over the last eight or nine days with foreign leaders that this is serious business,” Obama said. “You actually have to know what you are talking about and you actually have to have done your homework. When you speak, it should actually reflect thought out policy you can implement.” Trump on Wednesday raised eyebrows by saying that Russia’s president was “far more” of a leader than Obama. R
